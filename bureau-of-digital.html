                    <p> Carl Smith runs Bureau of Digital, an ultra-influential community 
                        of creative and digital agency owners.
                    </p>
                    <p>Bureau of Digital is making the web as collaborative as possible through 
                        events, learning, and sharing. Their portfolio of events includes Owner Camp,
                         Biz Dev Camp, Digital PM Summit and many more.
                    </p>
                    <p>After running a successful agency, Carl Smith bought Bureau of Digital 
                        and brought along Lori to help <a href="/support.html">support</a>
                         their events and keep up with the finances using Pulse.

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p> The Bureau of Digital is an events and education company for digital professionals. 
                        It’s a peer-based support networking for digital owners that didn’t go to school for 
                        what they now do. It puts them in a room with 30-100 other people to share their 
                        journey and give advice to one person while learning from someone else. Our source 
                        main revenue comes from ticket sales.

                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>Why did you come back to Pulse?</h2>
                </div>
                
                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>I used Pulse with <a href="/nGen-biz.html"> nGen</a> for many many years, but then I bought the Bureau of Digital
                         from Greg Hoy in June of 2016. We work with a great CPA firm, 
                        but I’m not that sophisticated and I hate spreadsheets.
                    </p>
                    <p>My journey back to Pulse started with a couple of months that didn’t go so well – I knew 
                        in my gut that something wasn’t going well. The problem was, I couldn’t start from the 
                        <a href="/cash-flow-basics.html">cash flow spreadsheets</a> because I was convinced that there was a problem in there but I 
                        couldn’t find it. There was no way to drill up to a high level. A seasoned accounting
                         professional could find it, but it
                         wasn’t there for me – I had to start from scratch.
                    </p>
                    <p>After going from spreadsheet to spreadsheet, I talked to Lori and said, “Get us back into
                         Pulse because I know how it works and it’s easy.”
                    </p>
                    <p>In Pulse, I can make a decision by unchecking a box next to an event and see if it’s 
                        going to kill our cash flow. In a spreadsheet, I have to highlight all this crap and 
                        I don’t know what the hell is going on. I was feeling out of 
                        control and I knew that Pulse would give me that control back.
                    </p>
                    <p>Lori: We reconcile all the incoming and outgoing cash from Xero. We had spreadsheets with all 
                        this information, but I couldn’t see where the numbers were coming from. Carl couldn’t
                        tell that he needed to put money in the bank to cover a future event. So if he has 
                        everything in there, he can see that the bank account looks low in March so we 
                        need to start selling the tickets for June’s event now.
                    </p>
                    <p>As an owner - especially if you’re running any type of business that can change really 
                        quickly – you need the ability to find those answers and act 
                        right away – not spend a month finding an answer.
                    </p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>Describe how you use Pulse and how it fits within your accounting workflow.</h2>
                </div>
    
                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>Carl: Bureau is more of a product company, so we did have to hack Pulse a
                         little bit. We put in our projections, and as things change, 
                        we go in and change the numbers to reflect the real stuff.
                    </p>
                    <p>Lori: I list expenses by event. I’ve got all our expenses for an event, 
                        but I’ve pieced it together the way Carl 
                        and I want it to work - not the way we used it at nGen.
                    </p>
                    <p>Carl: I gotta tell you, when you see the depth of what Lori’s done, Pulse looks
                         like a powerhouse. For the most part, the beauty of Pulse is its simplicity.
                          Even though Lori’s got every individual payment in there, with hundreds and 
                          hundreds of transactions a month – because you have a 
                        high-level drill-down – it still just feels manageable.
                    </p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>How has Pulse helped your business?</h2>
                </div>
    
                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>It allows me to answer questions really quickly. For example, we know 
                        that we’re running a little behind our goals, but if I know that I have 
                        an event and I know roughly how that event did, it’s really easy for me to
                         replicate that event and see how that affects my bottom line.
                    </p>
                    <p>If sales are looking low for a big event in October, then I can adjust our 
                        sales numbers for the next two months based on what I’ve
                         been seeing to tell me if I’m in trouble or not.
                    </p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>What’s the most important thing you get from Pulse?</h2>
                </div>
    
                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>Pulse gives me simple control. I know that if I look backward
                         (in Pulse), I’m looking at reality. 
                        If I look forward, I’m looking at projections.
                    </p>
                    <p>Having both of those in the same view is great because I know that I’m only
                         looking at half a guess. When reality hits at the end of the week and I see 
                         that our projections were not far off from our actual numbers, I have so much
                          confidence in the remaining numbers.
                    </p>
                    <p>At that point, I can think about taking everyone to a Marlins game and focus on the 
                        value my company provides instead of worrying about the revenue side.
                    </p>
                    <p>Lori: The biggest thing that we needed to see was that because we float so many of our
                         expenses on a credit card, Carl needs to see the up and down of the cash flow.
                          He needs to see when we project money coming in versus when money has to go out
                           and to see that outgoing cash
                         flow as accurate as it could be in a projection.
                    </p>
                    <p>Because I like numbers so much, the first thing I do every morning whenever I start
                         work is to make sure that the amount of money in the bank is the same amount that 
                         we have in Pulse and Xero. It usually doesn’t take me more than 30 minutes, but 
                         because we have ticket sales every day I reconcile the projected with the actuals. 
                         That may be overkill, but it lets us go in 
                        at any time and look at an accurate cash flow.
                    </p>
