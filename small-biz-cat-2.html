                    <p> <a href="/building.html">Greg Marano</a> of <a href="/building.html">The Syracuse Pen</a> loves teaching seventh-grade English, but he wanted
                         to use his writing skills more. So in 2015, 
                        he decided to try his hand at freelance writing and editing.
                    </p>
                    <p>When he started freelancing and marketing his skills, he wasn’t looking at niching into resumes.
                         But as he spoke with more and more people, Greg realized that there was significant demand for
                          resume writers. It wasn’t long before he decided to specialize in 
                        writing compelling resumes and helping his clients land their next job.
                    </p>
                    <p>In our recent episode of the <a href="/building.html">Cash Flow Show,</a> Greg shared his insights on running a side hustle
                         while maintaining a full-time job.

                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p> Juggling a job and a business isn’t easy, but Greg has a 
                        sustainable system that makes time for both.
                    </p>
                    <p>Greg attributes much of his success to the fact that he’s been teaching for 
                        13 years and has a strong support system in his full-time job. Not only 
                        does he have years of lesson plans to draw from, but he can share and 
                        streamline his ideas with co-workers. 
                         to his experience, he’s been able to create an ideal work environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>At school, he can focus on his students and grading papers. This lets Greg 
                        dedicate his time outside of school hours to freelancing.

                        <h2>Finding Clients
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>When you have limited time to spend on your side hustle, one struggle 
                        is finding out how to get clients. Originally, Greg started out on Upwork,
                         a marketplace for service providers and businesses to connect. And while 
                         that’s still a useful platform, he has since expanded into using 
                         channels and personal referrals for attracting clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>Word-of-mouth referrals are by far the most effective means of getting clients.
                         After all, people trust a friend or coworker over an ad. But Greg also leverages 
                          LinkedIn traffic and Google Ads, which he can turn on and off depending on his budget or workload. 
                        This provides him with a low-cost avenue to find high-quality clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I look at my ads and discover which forms are bringing me the best revenue,” says Greg.
                         “The ones that attract 
                        the most reliable and frequent customers are the ones I reinvest in.”
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>Organizing multiple sources of cash flow
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>It’s fairly common for business owners with two income sources, especially 
                        two active businesses, to get expert financial advice. While Greg keeps a 
                        spreadsheet of his general cash flow, he employs an accountant to help him 
                        prepare taxes and keep track of expenses.
                    </p>
                    <p>This allows him to get expert financial advice and focus more on what
                         matters—writing for his clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>But that doesn’t mean that Greg isn’t keeping an eye on his cash flow. With a
                         full-time job teaching, the pressure to grow his business’ revenue isn’t as 
                         intense as it is for other ventures, but he still likes to keep tabs on
                         his business finances and ensures that he maintains a low overhead.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a freelancer specializing in writing, overhead is generally low. Most of Greg’s
                         finances fall into the category of advertising or professional memberships, such 
                         as the Better <a href="/building.html">Business Bureau</a> and the <a href="/building.html">National Resume Writers Association.</a> 
                        He also keeps some money aside for computer upgrades or repairs.
                    </p>
                    <p>Greg occasionally uses cash flow projections but doesn’t lean on them.
                         Why? He usually outperforms his projections.
                    </p>
                    <p>“It's hard to project because the business is still growing. And it's grown every year since 
                        I started,” says Greg. “Every time I've made a projection, I've always gone well past it. 
                        So if I were to make a projection, 
                        I usually find that I'm projecting a little too conservatively.
