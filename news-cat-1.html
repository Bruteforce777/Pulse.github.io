                        chances are things have changed pretty dramatically 
                        from when you began. Due to the economy, competition
                         or even just your own interests, it’s possible that
                          what you set out to do isn’t quite what you ended up 
                          with, and that’s okay. Take a moment to review your mission
                           statement and overall goals. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Pull out that business plan you first put together when you were looking for
                        financing, and see how your long-term goals stack up against your real-world 
                        experience.”

                    <p>“Yes, it is your business. Yes, it is your financial stake and you are the one
                         taking the risk. And yet your team members are invested in the business too.
                          They spend their time, effort, and energy. Wouldn’t you like them to be more
                           personally invested in the success of the business? Let’s put it this way:
                           would you like your employees to think more like owners?

                    </p>
                    <p>If so, you have to involve them in the goals and planning for the business — 
                        i.e, you have to drive employee engagement. You may set the overall direction, 
                        but let them be involved in the creation of the outcomes. Slowing down enough to 
                        involve them in this important work is 
                        a big key to greater involvement, commitment and success.”

                    </p>
                    <p>“That means tracking invoices more closely, paying bills on time, asking 
                        utility providers for ways to save money, and scoping the market for 
                        competitive suppliers. Choose one area to

                    </div>
                    <p>Ditch your old performance reviews. Traditional performance reviews can actually
                         de-motivate your employees, as people consider a “review” or “feedback” a negative 
                         experience. Set your employees up for a more positive approach by reinventing the 
                         review process so that it focuses on employee strengths. Call it a “Goals and 
                         Performance Timeline.” Focus on your employee’s strengths,
                         and create initiatives together around setting goals for the coming year.
                    </p>
                    <p>A Gallup poll shows that employees who are able to focus on their strengths in
                         their positions are six times more engaged in their work and are eight percent
                          more productive than plain old worker bees. Engagement equals performance, 
                        and your business – and employees – will be better for it.”
