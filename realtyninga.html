                    <p>My name is Casimir Loeber and I am co-founder of <a href="realtyninga.html">RealtyNinja.</a> We are a creative 
                        agency that specializes in custom web design and development, print and graphic 
                        design. We are a tight team that prides itself in our agility and ability to

                    <h2>What were the reasons that lead you to start using Pulse?</h2>
                </div>
                
                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>As most <a href="entreprenuership-main.html">entrepreneurs</a> will know, there are never enough hours in the day
                         to do the work that pays the bills, let alone the behind the scenes work most
                         of us hate to do. Both my business partner and myself knew from the beginning
                          that we were not the accountant types or even good bookkeepers. 
                          What we did know how to do was preserve the paper trail and plug numbers 
                          into websites. This lead us to pulse which allowed us to visualize our cash 
                          flow before our brains turned to snow
                         with receipts, spread sheets and accordion folders.
                    </p>

                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>Describe how you use Pulse and how it fits within your accounting workflow.</h2>
                </div>
    
                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>Before we had a bookkeeper we would simply export our invoice totals from our invoicing 
                        system (Freshbooks!) and enter these values as income in pulse. We were pretty good with 
                        our expense paper trails and would just go through our credit card and cheque book for 
                        these values. As things started to ramp up and consume more time, we hired a bookkeeper 
                        and gave her the keys to our pulse account. She was able to pick it up in no time and
                         now all we do is log in every couple of days to see where we are, where we are headed 
                         and where we came from. If we have a large prospect on the horizon we take 2 seconds to 
                        put it in pulse to see how it effects us; simple as that.

                    <h2>What do you like most about Pulse?</h2>
                </div>
    
                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>What I like most about pulse is that it turns something that is very
                         number heavy and hard to visualize into something that is easy to 
                         look at. I can take a quick look at my Pulse account and see exactly 
                         where we miscalculated on a quote and how long it took us to recover 
                         from that. The reporting functionality is definitely the strong point 
                         with pulse and has the potential to be expanded in many great directions.

                    <p>Pulse has taken the fear and stress out of <a href="cash-flow-basics.html">cash flow projection</a> and management.
                         It has seriously made it so that I can sleep better knowing that I am not going
                          to randomly run out of cash tomorrow. It is easy to learn and easy to teach, so
                         integrating it into our work flow was not an issue at all.

                        I can’t wait to see what the people at Pulse will cook up next.
