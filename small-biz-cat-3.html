                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>At 21, <a href="/building.html">Isaac Mashman</a> found himself in California
                         trying to find his place in life while the pandemic raged outside 
                         his doorstep. Working as a freelancer and sole proprietor,
                        he knew he would get a stimulus check.
                    </p>
                    <p>And he decided to do something different with it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Instead of squirrel away his stimulus money for a rainy day, 
                        Isaac decided to invest it into launching a business. Thus,
                         on April 17, 2020, the public relations firm Mashman Ventures 
                         was born. Through his company, Isaac helps business owners, 
                         musicians, and other ambitious individuals build and leverage 
                         their personal brands to drive leads, book gigs, and get seen.
                    </p>
                    <p>While his company is only a year and a half old, he's managed to
                         bring on 13 team members without any outside funding. Building 
                         this team, keeping his operations simple, and staying flexible 
                         has led to Mashman Ventures’ wild success.
                    </p>
                    <p>We sat down with Isaac in our recent episode of The Cash Flow Show 
                        to talk about his success and what other
                         business owners and entrepreneurs can learn from it.

                        <h2>Starting From Scratch
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p> Isaac rooted his company in personal branding and public relations.
                         Why? He knew he was good at it and had been working with branding 
                         since 2017. From starting a record label to dropshipping, Isaac had 
                         tried everything. In the process, he always felt most successful leaning
                          into personal branding.
                    </p>
                    <p>As Isaac realized that he had become the “go-to” guy for personal branding
                        among his friends, he knew that a specialized PR business had potential. 
                        Pandemic stimulus check in hand, he decided to invest in himself and commit
                         to the business.
                    </p>
                    
                </div>
                
                <div class="schooling">
                    <h4>“...if you’re bootstrapping your business, you just need to go all in.”
                    </h4>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p> Since Isaac decided to start his business on his own, he ditched 
                        a traditional business plan and went with his gut.
                    </p>
                    <p>With a traditional plan, you may sit down and write down every detail
                         about your business, from your company summary to marketing goals and 
                         market research. These documents can easily cross 40 or 50 pages in 
                         length, and they take weeks to write.
                    </p>
                    <p>Instead of spending excessive time planning, Isaac spoke with successful
                         professionals, decided on what services he would provide, and hit the 
                         ground running.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Based on personal experience and talking to a lot of people, the only 
                        time you need a business plan is if you’re building with co-founders 
                        or if you need to raise funds,” says Isaac. “But if you’re 
                        bootstrapping your business, you just need to go all in.”
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>Invest in your team</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Isaac shared that a key differentiator for him was building a team.
                         While sole proprietors and freelancers can offer a quality service,
                          it can be difficult to scale. And for many clients, especially in PR,
                           the lack of a team can make you seem less credible.
                    </p>
                    <p>To scale quickly, Isaac knew that he would need people to be a part of the vision.
                    </p>
                    <p>“We have a team of 13 people, 14, including myself, and that also includes 
                        people that are providing additional assistance outside of personal 
                        branding or PR services,” says Isaac.
                    </p> 
                    <p>But not every team member Isaac brought on is directly related to his clients’
                        needs. In fact, he decided to reinvest in his employees’ mental and physical
                         wellbeing by hiring health experts.
                    </p>  
                    <p>“We have a lead mental health advisor. We also have a lead personal trainer who
                         provides services and incentives to everybody else on the team for no cost
                          to them simply to ensure their health is great. And that was very
                          important to me.”
                    </p>
                    <p>One of the reasons Isaac decided to bring health experts on board for his 
                        employees was because he realized how beneficial it is. Because mental and
                         physical health is largely built through accountability and positive 
                         influences, Isaac believes in prioritizing a support system at work to 
                         ensure his employees feel taken care of.

                    </p>
                    <p>“I sleep better at night knowing if that someone on my team is going through
                         a rough time, not just in our business, but on their own, they have access 
                         to someone who can walk with them,” says Isaac.
                    </p>
                    <p>In bringing together a talented team of specialists, Isaac has been able to 
                        focus solely on growth. With the company on track to hit the million-dollar
                         mark by 2024, Isaac has leveraged personal branding for his own agency.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>Take a results-oriented<br> approach to consulting</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>While Isaac has a large team, he’s structured his business around a
                         consultancy model that has him getting on a call with every 
                         client. On these calls, Isaac reviews the client’s personal
                          branding strategy and trains them to meet their goals. All of 
                          this is a part of providing high-quality customer service and 
                          ensuring results.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I’m teaching them the aspects of personal branding that a lot of 
                        people are afraid to discuss because people believe that you’re 
                        creating increased competition in the marketplace,” says Isaac.
                    </p>
                    <p>Moving into 2022, Isaac will continue to refine his model. 
                        Instead of building a course or becoming an educational guru,
                         he wants to work more closely with his independent contractors. 
                         He hopes he can further scale his business without sacrificing 
                         quality by providing training for his current and future team members.
                    </p> 
                </div>
                
                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>Keep your accounting simple</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>When it comes to consulting as a business model, expenses are usually 
                        fairly low. With most of his expenses linked to increasing his headcount,
                         the consultancy model offers a high-profit margin with very low overhead.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Everybody on our team is currently remote, and for the most part, we don't
                         have a lot of expenses. And that maximizes the amount of revenue that we
                          can get from each project.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Marketing is another expense, but it’s been a fun and creative reinvestment. 
                        Isaac regularly invests in offline marketing tactics. Rather than wait 
                        online for clients to roll in, he invests in hoodies and other merch to 
                        attract clients offline.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I think guerilla marketing is really an underrated tool now, especially 
                        because everybody's been locked down,” says Isaac. “But now that the country
                         is opening up, people will be going out and connecting.”

                    </p>
                    <p>Outside of marketing, basic tools like Calendly, and his staff, Isaac’s
                         expense sheet is short. And since he bootstrapped his business, 
                         he doesn’t need to present his financial decisions to a co-founder or
                          investor.

                    </p>
                    <p>As a result, Isaac’s business accounting is fairly simple. He runs the 
                        numbers and his projects on a spreadsheet and tracks revenue from month 
                        to month.

                    </p>
                    <p>By running simple projections, Isaac has managed to grow and support his
                         team quickly without spreading his finances too thin.
