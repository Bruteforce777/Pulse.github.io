                         a small beachside town in Southwestern France. The team seeks to solve the problems
                          of nursing homes and hospitals around the world, which are struggling to provide assistance
                         to the rapidly multiplying number of the elderly and their families.

                    <p>With decades of experience in biomedical engineering and general robotics, Vincent 
                        started KOMPAÏ Robotics in 2016 to create a solution to this crisis with a robot
                         designed to help caregivers and patients.
                    </p>
                    <p>Although their robot focuses primarily on assisting caregivers, Vincent and 
                        his team must work out a specific problem: how it will interact with 
                        multiple people with different goals, including the caregiver, the patient,
                         and the patient’s family. The KOMPAÏ also functions as a companion robot,
                          built to help seniors monitor their health, talk with friends, family, 
                          and their doctors, and even walk. In other words, these robots 
                        can also help the elderly to maintain their autonomy longer.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>“The biggest challenge is that robots can do anything,” says Vincent.
                        “We had to define a few functions that make sense. 
                        This meant we churned out 20 to 30 prototypes to 
                        eventually reach something that made sense for the end-user.”
                    </p>
                    <p>The engineers at KOMPAÏ Robotics test it at multiple hospitals and nursing 
                        homes in the region. They don’t just test for functionality, but for emotions.
                         Using focus groups at hospitals and other nursing homes, they have been able 
                         to define the size of the robot,
                         its global appearance, functions, and make it acceptable to all users.

                    <p>Now in its third model, you can find the KOMPAÏ at EHPAD Adarpea, a nursing 
                        home only ten minutes away from the team’s workshop. During lunch, this robot
                         roams the cafeteria, showing a film or playing music on its screen to promote
                          conversation among the elderly residents as they wait for their meal. 
                          This same machine can take a stroll with residents, allowing them to use
                           it for support without the hassle of pushing the machine. For the nurses 
                           and other caregivers, KOMPAÏ can remind patients of when to take their
                           medicine and how much to take, call 
                        for help in case of an emergency, and collect and store healthcare data.
                    </p>
                    <p>When COVID-19 became a concern, KOMPAÏ adapted to the crisis. They created an alert 
                        to remind users to wash their hands and take other health precautions to prevent
                         the spread.
                    </p>
                    <p>KOMPAÏ version 3 is approaching the end of its testing phase. But the journey 
                        has been a long one. When you look at KOMPAÏ’s current selection of healthcare-based
                         robotic caregivers with huge human-like eyes and
                         a touch screen, it’s hard to look back at where this dream began.
                    </p>
                    <p>Vincent started his journey towards biomedical engineering in 1975 at the Université de
                         Technologie de Compiègne. When he joined the SPARTACUS project and developed a robot
                         for quadriplegics, he found it both interesting and motivating. But shortly after his 
                         studies, he had to stray from healthcare robotics
                         and pivot into industrial and military robotics engineering.
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>“The reason for shifting into general robotics was very simple. During the 80s and 90s,
                         there was no money available for healthcare robotics.
                         All of the funding and research went into military and industrial pursuits.”
                    </p>
                    <p>In 1985, Vincent co-founded Robosoft, where he made a breakthrough in robotics.
                        Robosoft designed and created the first mobile robot called the roboTER. Think
                         of it as an earlier version of robotic sweepers, square and compact, with the
                          ability to handle hundreds of pounds. As one of the first mobile robots dedicated 
                          to research, traces of the roboTER
                         can be found in hundreds of other robots made by Robosoft and KOMPAÏ.

                    <p>The dedicated engineers continued to develop and refine their robots.

                          allowed them to engineer robots that drive Vincent and the company today:

                        The other was to create robots that would help solve the aging crisis in Europe."

                    <p>Studies show that by 2050, the number of elderly people needing long-term 
                        care will likely double. But the economic drawbacks to an aging population
                         will come much sooner. Increasingly 
                        larger generations are entering the stages of senior citizenship.
                    </p>
                    <p>The state of care will offer its own set of issues. Seniors will need intuitive
                         devices to keep them in touch with their physicians, family, and friends. 
                         Mobile devices can do some of the legwork, but these smaller gadgets are regularly updated and 
                        don’t have as much functionality as a full-on caregiver.
                    </p>
                    <p>“The problem we wanted to address is that by 2050, 10 million caregivers

                    </p>
                    <p>In order to make KOMPAÏ a reality, Vincent and his team at KOMPAÏ Robotics 
                        must balance their time between their main goal and other contracts. 
                        This is because like any other business, but more so in a company that 
                        requires research and copious amounts of testing, Vincent must find ways 
                        to finance the research. One way is to continue taking on contracts that 
                        relate to their specialty: autonomous vehicles. Three or four days of the
                         workweek, the team meets in the office to focus on their robots and robotic 
                         consulting. Their main bread and butter are the military 
                        defense robots, mainly off-road and all-terrain vehicles.

                        Vincent has been able to dedicate four people from their 10-person
                         team to work full-time on the project. To gain access to this program,
                          KOMPAÏ joined a larger initiative focused on solving the aging crisis 
                          in Europe with industry and policy called SHAPES.
