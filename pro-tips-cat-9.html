                    <p>This guest post from business consultant <a href="#">Don Dalrymple </a>explains why
                         your business needs to be concerned about your Cash
                         flow and how Pulse can help you take control of you finances.
                    </p>
                    <p>A hope and a dream can go a long way to motivate an entrepreneur,
                        but it soon fades as a way to manage
                         a growing business in the daily realities of cash management.
                    </p>
                    <p>It's often said that cash is the life blood of a growing business. 
                        In a world where the landscape changes quickly, this has never been
                        more true. Your unseen competitor or the lack or adoption of your new 
                        product can cause your business to have to pivot quickly.
                    </p>
                    <p> <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> What if you have to spend more on a strategy you did not anticipate?<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> What if you have to invest in resources in order to win new business?<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> What if you have to take more risk because the game has changed?
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">            
                    <p>These are questions that need more than a gut decision. You have to know your cash position at any given
                         time to be able to make an informed and confident decision.
                    </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, you need to be able to anticipate different scenarios 
                        and know what kind of risk you would be taking.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is why you need Pulse for cash management and forecasting your cash decisions.</p>
                    <p>Unlike accounting software and financial analysis, <a href="#">Pulse</a> helps you see what could 
                        happen in the future and the impacts that can happen from different scenarios. 
                        Here are a few ways this powerful tool helps business owners and CFO's make 
                        informed and empowering decisions:

                    <p>Sometimes it may be necessary to let a difficult customer go. Other times
                         a customer may not want to continue to do business. Pulse helps business owners and managers to
                         understand how much of an impact on cash flow this will have.

                        Managers can tie their revenue targets to monthly cash cushions.

                         Having a clear picture of where the dips are in your cash flow 
                        can help you come up with strategies to curb those dips far ahead of time.
