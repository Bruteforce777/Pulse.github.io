                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>Five years ago, <a href="/building.html">Jonathan Saeidian</a> was working for a marketing agency in Los Angeles 
                        as a salesman, struggling to make his first sale. In his first four months, he hadn’t
                         managed to close a deal. Instead of giving up, Jonathan threw himself into his work.
                    </p>
                    <p>Within six months, he had become the top salesman in the agency. But during the
                         course of his brief tenure, Jonathan realized something important about the agency
                          industry: The operations were extremely 
                        outdated and clients ended up footing the bills for these inefficiencies.
                    </p>
                    <p>He knew he could do better.
                    </p>
                    <p>His solution? To bootstrap a lean and efficient agency with a 
                        modern structure that benefited both the agency and its clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>With just $2,000 in his pocket, Jonathan set out to develop 
                        <a href="/building.html">Brenton Way,</a> his own digital marketing agency. 
                        Today, that same agency is now a seven-figure business.
                    </p>
                    <p>In our recent episode of the Cash Flow Show, Jonathan
                         took us through his journey to success and how cash 
                         flow allows him to provide value to clients.

                    <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                        <h2>Streamline operations </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Jonathan’s goal to reform the agency model was rooted in 
                        two primary issues he noticed in the agency world:    
                    </p>
                    <p> 1. Internal and client communications contained redundancies and inefficiencies, mainly due to a lack of technology.<br>
                        2. Clients ended up paying for activities that brought them no value.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to remedy these two issues, Jonathan decided to focus entirely 
                        on operations for the first few years rather than grow his team. 
                        He also reinvested in creating original technology for his agency.
                    </p>
                </div>    
                
                <div class="schooling">
                    <h4>“If you truly understand the entire cost of an item or a service, 
                        you can use that in your sales tactics and how you sell that item”
                    </h4>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>Focusing on creating efficient frameworks had the added bonus of reducing the
                         client’s price point and finding Breton Way’s market fit, 
                        which Jonathan has turned into his business strategy. 
                    </p>
                    <p>“If you truly understand the entire cost of an item or a service, you can use that in your
                         sales tactics and how you sell that item,” says Jonathan.
                    </p>
                    <p>Jonathan has been able to differentiate his business through tracking the baseline of his expenses.

                    </p>
                    <p>For example, if you provide a marketing service and know the operational 
                        cost is $500 and you’re selling it for $1,000, and you remove $300 for taxes,
                         you know that $200 is left for potential marketing revenue.
                    </p>
                    <p><a href="/building.html">Projecting your costs</a> allows you to price appropriately 
                        and maintain a budget for attracting new clients.
                    </p>
                    <p>“So if you have that financial ability to really break down your entire cost model, 
                        you can really use it to leverage your promos and incentives,” says Jonathan. “And this allows you 
                        to really kick out competitors. And that's something we've done.”
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                        <h2>Scale with a purpose</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p> One decision that Jonathan made early on was to scale slowly.
                    </p>
                    <p>“We literally spent like the first three years under $100,000, $200,000 in
                         quarterly revenue. I'll say on purpose,” says Jonathan. “Most agencies 
                        don't succeed because they don't have the right infrastructure to scale.”
                    </p>
                    <p>While the team at Brenton Way made sure to adapt to the influx of leads, 
                        they stayed focused on developing a functional and 
                        streamlined framework before taking their business to the next level.
                    </p>  
                    <p>An agency needs new team members and resources to scale successfully, and 
                        onboarding people or technologies too quickly can result in miscommunication
                         and inefficiencies. Once issues start cropping up, these costs ultimately end 
                        up getting passed down to the end client, which Jonathan wanted to avoid
                    </p> 
                </div>

                <div class="schooling">
                    <h4>“Most agencies don't succeed because they don't have the right
                         infrastructure to scale.”
                    </h4>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text"> 
                    <p> “We focused on eliminating these potential inefficiencies. That way, we don't have to charge a huge retainer to the client,” says Jonathan. “And I think that's a huge benefit. Because if you are affordable, clients are more
                         likely to stay. You can eventually take on more clients.” 
                    </p>
                    <p>It was critical for Jonathan and his team to scale with intention
                         rather than deal with uncontrolled and potentially destructive growth.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                        <h2>Focus on dominating</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p> In addition to working on frameworks, Jonathan wanted to bring their
                         marketing technology in-house. While it can be more cost-effective 
                         to outsource technology solutions, such as tools for ad campaigns 
                         or social scheduling, Jonathan realized he could use proprietary 
                        technology as both a key differentiator and operational tool.
                    </p> 
                    <p>“I tell my team that we don't compete, we dominate. We don't consider ourselves 
                        in any sphere as most of our 
                        competitors,” says Jonathan. “Because we build our own technology.”
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, Jonathan has reinvested in his team’s technology to develop a
                         customized and centralized dashboard to view ad campaigns, analytics, and 
                         other marketing essentials. The upfront costs of developing
                         the technology were blips when it came to reviewing its ROI.
                    </p>
                    <p>“These elements allow us to be a product, not just a service,” says Jonathan.
                         “And I think when you bring those two together, that's our goal in the 
                         next five years is to be a product-focused agency. Where when you have to 
                         choose between us and another agency,
                         we bring so much value that it's not even a competition.”
                    </p>

                    <p>To scale Brenton Way, Jonathan broke down his costs in order
                         to understand when to scale, how to streamline operations, 
                         and how to reinvest in the business. Reviewing his cash flow
                          ultimately allowed him to
