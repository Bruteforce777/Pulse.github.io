                </h2>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p> When we bought Pulse in October of 2013, it had been a flat business 
                        for three years. I knew the previous owners personally and knew they
                         hadn't neglected Pulse, but they weren't actively building new 
                         features, either. For them, 
                        Pulse was a steady income stream, but they were busy with other things.
                    </p>
                    <p>What's incredible, and why we were so excited about Pulse, is that
                         the business was still finding new users every month, enough to 
                         replace those who were closing their accounts. In SaaS parlance, 
                         when churn (the percentage of customers closing
                         accounts) matches paid signups, the result is a flat business.
                    </p>
                    <p>In any business, the simplest way to grow is to give customers a good
                         experience. One of the biggest components to user experience is speed.
                          Below, I'll talk about three things we
                         did in our first year, all focused on speed, to revitalize Pulse.
                    </p>
                    <p>We have miles to go, but the little improvements 
                        we've made so far have made a measurable impact.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>Faster, Consistent, Thoughtful Customer Service
                    </h2>
                </div>    
                
                <div class="social-text">
                    
                    <p> Whether we get a customer support ticket or a sales enquiry, 
                        we take the time to write back a thoughtful response—and we respond quickly. 
                        Phase 1 was to respond consistently within one business day, and we do that.
                         Phase 2, which we're working on now, is to respond to every ticket within 
                         half a day. Phase 3, our ultimate goal, is to respond within an hour 
                         (preferable within minutes).
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition to the turnaround time for tickets, when we took over Pulse 
                        and reviewed the customer support history, we saw a lot of replies that
                         didn't make the customers feel warm and fuzzy. For example, customers 
                         often write in with a feature request we don't plan on implementing. 
                         Previously, the request may have been ignored entirely, or a typical 
                         response would have been, "Thanks for the suggestion, but we do not 
                         plan on implementing Feature X." And with regards to bug reports, 
                         a previous response might have been, "Sorry for the trouble. 
                         Things are back to normal now. 
                        Email us again if you have any other problems."
                    </p>
                    <p>However, now our responses are more thorough:</p>
                    <p>"Hi Sally, Our hosting company just had a half hour incident that brought
                         us down (they had to replace some failed hardware), but it's over now.
                          We are working with them to ensure it doesn't happen again. 
                          Try now, it should be back to normal. I'm really sorry for the
                           headache. Is there anything else I can help you with?" When the situation
                         warrants it, we also proactively offer up an account credit.
                    </p>
                    <p>The key here is that we're just being a little more specific 
                        (mentioning failed hardware) and thoughtful (sorry for the headache).
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>Pagespeed and Stability
                    </h2>
                </div>    
                
                <div class="social-text">
                   
                    <p>One of our main areas of investment in our first year of business wasn't
                         in redesigning Pulse, though Simple Focus is known for our visual design.
                          While we do want to update the look of the app to feel more contemporary,
                           and it's 
                        in the roadmap, it's not a higher priority than the app's stability.
                    </p>
                    <p>Our biggest user experience hurdle with Pulse when we took it over
                         was that it had a lot of errors and would go down periodically. 
                         We dug in our heels, hired a performance expert to consult with us,
                         and stopped the errors (while making the app load faster). 
                         If we look at when Pulse started growing 
                        fastest over the last year, it's when we implemented these fixes.
                    </p>   
                    <p>When you sign up for a new membership or service, set a reminder in your 
                        calendar for six months later. If you haven’t seen the value that you anticipated,
                         cancel your account before it auto-renews.

                    <h2>Faster-Loading Marketing Site

                <div class="social-text">
                    
                    <p>We redesigned our marketing site to be mobile-friendly and load faster. We know from 
                        the work we do consulting with our clients on lead-gen, conversions and eCommerce,
                         that speed has a strong correlation to conversion rate. So, we made sure the 
                         marketing site was fast. Right now, the marketing site reaches document-complete 
                         around two seconds and is fully loaded around seven seconds (on IE10, Cable,
                          according to <a href="/building.html">WebPagetest</a> ). There's plenty of room for improvement, 
                          but it's way faster than it was.

                    <p> Stay tuned as we begin to work on smaller, more incremental improvements
                         to Pulse and begin to invest in marketing and sales, while continuing to
                          stay focused on improving speed. And even though we've almost doubled 
                          revenue in the first year of owning Pulse, I've always believed that you
                          should have a solid product before you mash the pedal for growth, 
                        and over the last year with Pulse, that's what we've focused on.
                    </p>
                    <p>With these speed problems at bay, we can start working on the fun stuff like more
                         modern interactions and a cleaner design. But we'll always keep speed and 
                         performance at the top of the list.
