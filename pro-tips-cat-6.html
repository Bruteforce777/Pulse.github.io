                    <p>First and foremost, Pulse is designed to manage cash flow, so our entire system 
                        is optimized around the idea that your past transactions 
                        are not as important as your projected income and expenses. However...
                    </p>
                    <p>Pulse also does a great job at tracking actuals against projections. And,
                         with categories, you can generate reports that will help your accountant at 
                         the end of the year (as long as you've input your income and expenses accurately).

                    <h2>Here's How To Do It</h2>
                </div>   

                <div class="social-text">  
                          
                    <p>First, you need to set up two <span class="highlights">Financial Accounts.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>Do this by going to Settings near the top right and then clicking on Accounts in the 
                        right sidebar. Or, just click Edit near the 
                        Accounts module on the right-hand side of the Cash Flow tab.
                    </p>
                    <p>You'll need two accounts: one for tracking your actuals and one for your projections. 
                        You can set up multiple accounts if you have different business units or profit centers 
                        for your business, just make sure you are on a plan that has enough accounts included.
                         Name them whatever you want, but for our simple demonstration, create one called 
                         Actuals and one called Projections.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>Set Up Projections</h2>
                </div>     

                <div class="social-text"> 
                         
                    <p>Whether you set up a budget annually or track projections throughout the year,
                         this is your account for playing with your anticipated income and expenses.
                          Put in possible projects, sales leads, anticipated hires, big annual expenses
                           – whatever you are forecasting. If you want to use your projections as a budget
                           for the entire fiscal year, 
                        then call this financial account Budget instead of Projections.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>Track Actuals</h2>
                </div>    

                <div class="social-text">       
                    <p>Now, since your projections aren't necessarily realized income and expenses,
                        you'll use your Actuals account to track your actual income and expenses. 
                        Luckily, you won't have to re-enter categories – they are all available for
                         both financial accounts. While your projections will span into the future, 
                         your the entries in your Actuals account will be filled
                        out as time passes, creating a history of past transactions.
                    </p>
                </div> 
                
                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>Now that you have everything set up, you can toggle the checkboxes by your
                         financial accounts from your Cash Flow (monthly, weekly or list) and Reports 
                         screens to see your projections versus your actuals. Make sure to adjust the dates that you are 
                        running reports on so that you can compare apples to apples.
                    </p>

                    <h2>But Don't Stop Managing Cash Flow</h2>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>Pulse is best used as a cash flow management tool, so always keep
                         another financial account for continually managing your projected
                         income and expenses, knowing that when it comes to cash flow, all 
                         that matter is how much money you have 
                        today and how much you have coming in and going out in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's incredibly helpful to use Pulse as a simple accounting system,
                         and comparing actuals to projections (or a budget) is a great way 
                         to measure your business' ability to hit its projections. But,
                          Pulse was designed for managing situations when projections and 
                          actuals may not align. Keep this in mind and use Pulse to figure 
                          out how to manage your cash flow through the tough times 
                          as well as how best to reinvest (or if you
                         can take money out of the business) during the good times.
