                <div class="social-text">
                   
                    <p>I have a friend who runs a small landscaping business. During the 
                        winter months, he turns his attention from mowing and pruning to 
                        clearing snow and assisting homeowners in winterizing their property. 
                        He also takes a vacation during one of the winter months, 
                        as opposed to the busy summertime when his services are in higher demand.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many businesses see more or less consistent cash flow throughout the year, 
                        but for others, seasonal peaks and valleys are a way of life. Whether your
                         business has seasonal products, accounting, logistics or changes in the 
                         amount of work you receive from your clients, learning to predict and 
                         manage these fluctuations is crucial to business sustainability. Fortunately,
                          you can take steps to minimize 
                        losses during these periods of inconsistent revenue.

                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>Cash Flow is Predictable
                    </h2>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    
                    <p>The first and most important thing you can do to understand your slow periods is 
                        to accurately monitor and forecast cash flow. With a correct and consistent 
                        prediction of seasonal lulls, you can take action to 
                        reduce the impact of these valleys on your annual bottom line.
                    </p>
                    <p>Forecasting cash flow for a seasonal business is the same as for
                         a year-round business, but actually more predictable. While all
                          businesses must contend with the normal fluctuations of revenue and expenses,
                           seasonal businesses will have an easier time estimating revenue in
                            the off-season (particularly if the business is closed in the off-season).
                             Expenses during this interval can become very predictable indeed, 
                        especially if they are cut down to the bare necessities.

                    <h2>Ways To Reduce Loss
                    </h2>

                <div class="social-text">
                   
                    <p>There are at least three ways to brace your business for seasonal lulls:
                   </p>
                   <p>  <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Spend less money during these slow months by communicating with vendors (possibly reducing 
                            payment terms to keep cash in the business).
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>  Cut unneeded spendings such as subscriptions, equipment rentals, or services that can be 
                            temporarily suspended.
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>  Reduce labor force during slow periods. This may not be a viable option for all
                            small businesses, however, particularly those with a small number of employees (perhaps even just one.)
                   </p>
                   <p>A better alternative is to diversify goods and services offered during the off-season. 
                        This way, you’re not just lowering expenses but you’re bringing cash back into the business.
                        For example, a self-employed photographer who specializes in wedding photography would 
                         look for other avenues of income during the slower months, such as photography for 
                        holiday cards, “save-the-dates”, or creative projects they might not have 
                        time to explore during the busy wedding season.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">

                    <p>And the best way to plan is to carefully watch and forecast your cash flow and expected 
                        projects. This way, your small business can save some of the cash on hand from your 
                        profitable months to offset your expenses during slow months. This is where Pulse 
                        comes in handy. By comparing to previous periods of low demand, you can have a reasonable 
                        idea of how much revenue to
                         expect from their customers. (Or, what revenue to not expect.)
