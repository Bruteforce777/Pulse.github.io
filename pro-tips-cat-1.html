                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>Professional services, especially digital advertising services, are widely 
                        popular due to the low overhead and how quickly they can go to market.
                         But this can be a double-edged sword for an agency owner who is trying 
                         to offer as many services as possible. It’s 
                        far too easy to overpromise and underdeliver if you lack direction.
                    </p>
                    <p>In mid-2017, SEO specialist <a href="/building.html">Brogan Renshaw</a> saw this pitfall 
                        first-hand at the general marketing firm he was working at.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the time, he was unable to deal directly with clients and his superiors 
                        were overpromising SEO results, in part because they didn’t understand the 
                        discipline. When he left the company, Brogan realized that he could land 
                        clients on his own. So he investigated the market and discovered that there were
                         no single-service agencies focused on SEO in his region of Australia.
                    </p>
                    <p>When he noticed the gap in the market, he decided to start his own agency, 
                        FireWire Digital. While he specialized in SEO and Google ads, Brogan also took 
                        on some social media ad projects for initial revenue. But within 12 months, 
                        he was able to drop social ad services and focus solely on SEO.
                    </p>
                    <p>We spoke with Brogan to learn more about how he manages the several expenses
                         that are associated with SEO and how he’s grown his business.
                    </p>

                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>1. Narrow down your services</h2>
                    </div>          
                    <p>Brogan’s passion was in SEO, and while he initially needed to take on 
                        unrelated projects to get his business started, he rapidly narrowed his
                         services list. Failing to niche down and provide specific, quality 
                         services is a huge problem for businesses. 
                        And that’s true even outside of the professional services industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>In fact, one of the main reasons businesses fail is lack of expertise or 
                        poor marketing—two problems that 
                        stem from a business owner trying to do too much at once.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I often tell people, from several businesses I've worked with, that businesses
                         that succeed can succeed despite their owners,” says Brogan. “When you specialize,
                          you're not trying to be everything for 
                        everyone. You’re not stretching yourself too thin.”
                    </p>
                    <p>In keeping his services list small, Brogan has built a thriving and highly
                         specialized agency that consistently delivers quality products.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>2. Choose your tools wisely</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Another benefit of niching his services list is reducing overhead costs. 
                        SEO tools are expensive, and there are thousands of variations.
                         One of the biggest barriers to entry is the cost of premium software.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, the popular keyword and market research tool <a href="/building.html">SEMRush </a>can cost more than
                         $500 a month. And while there are many free options, they don’t cover everything an 
                         SEO specialist needs to do their job.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I was lucky that when I started, I had some initial income and could purchase some of 
                        the basic tools,” says Brogan. “At the time, I was probably only using about 20% of 
                        the tools we have now. The costs of tools are massive.”
                    </p>
                    <p>The key, Brogan tells us, is that business owners need to be selective and strategic 
                        when choosing their first tools. The focus should be on what combination of 
                        software will provide the best results for the client.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>3. Build a second stream of income</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Another critical aspect is setting prices. Services agencies can choose to charge by the hour,
                         project, or a percentage of the revenue generated.
                    </p>
                    <p>While Brogan charges on a project and retainer basis, he also recently established an affiliate
                         marketing component to his business. His team always had the skills necessary to implement it 
                         but lacked the time and resources. With the main business thriving, Brogan decided it was time to
                        finally bring in this second stream of income.
                    </p>
                    <p>“It's almost like a separate business within the company. You have your client-side, and then you have
                         the affiliate-side,” says Brogan. “What we like to do is buy an existing 
                        site that's a little bit established and then build it up.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Brogan’s affiliate marketing program is based on the following steps:
                    </p>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Buy a site<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Optimize it.<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Add quality content.<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Sell the website again.
                    </p>
                    <p>These websites generally sell at 30-40 times their monthly revenue, which offers a significant 
                        second income stream. For example, if Brogan has a website that brings in $100 per month, 
                        he could sell it for $3,000. Ideally, he works on generating $1,000 in revenue for his affiliate sites,
                         so he can sell them for closer to $30,000.
                    </p>
                    <p>Good candidates include websites that are already fairly established. A website should have 
                        some existing content and traffic with the potential to grow. At this stage, it’s important to 
                        conduct an SEO audit to map out both potential problems and opportunities. For 
                        every potential investment, Brogan has to ask questions like:
                    </p>
                    <p> <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> What is the website’s capacity?<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> How's your website going to rank?<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Who are your competitors?<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Are you targeting the right words?<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Are you doing the right type of content?
                    </p>
                    <p>Once Brogan buys a website, he optimizes the technical SEO aspects, adds additional
                         quality content, and establishes affiliate connections with the website. Over time, 
                        the website’s affiliate revenue rises, and all Brogan needs is a buyer.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">

                    </div>
                    <p>Between his regular clients and affiliate marketing program, Brogan has been able to
                         steadily grow his business. Client retainers provide access to immediate and predictable capital. 
                         The affiliate websites act as long-term investments, with their current affiliate revenue offsetting
                          a portion of the expenses. Together, the two income streams provide more
                         flexibility and prevent revenue from drying out during slow periods.

                    <h4>“I think that as a business owner, you have to track cash flow. I mean, otherwise, 
                        you're just burying your head in the sand, and you're asking for problems”
                    </h4>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>Agencies are regularly subjected to dips and peaks when it comes to cash flow.
                         Due to the fluctuating nature of the business, Brogan focuses on 
                        six-month projections when monitoring his cash flow.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Even when you have a general average of new clients coming in, you've also got 
                        to factor in what the 
                        drop-off rate is, and try and work that out,” Brogan notes.
                    </p>
                    <p>He also keeps a granular list of all of his business’ monthly expenses and
                         reviews software usage each month. Any platform
                         that hasn’t been used for the last three months gets axed immediately.

                        understanding your cash flow at a glance is critical for success. Not only 
                        can you make better decisions, but 
                        it’s easier to spot expense creep and unused software subscriptions.

                    <p>“I think that as a business owner, you have to track cash flow. I mean,

                        for problems,” says Brogan. “Around 80% of businesses fail in their first couple of years, 
                        and I'd say that's often down to the management of the money.”
                    </p>
