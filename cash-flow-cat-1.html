                    <p> Since 2002, Shari Easton of Tulsa Oklahoma has been installing and 
                        repairing tilework across the Midwest. Working under the business name 
                        of Masterful Tile Creation, Shari has spent nearly two decades providing 
                        high-quality service, designs, and installation services.
                    </p>
                    <p>Shari recently shared the behind-the-scenes operations of her business, 
                        namely how she finances and bills her projects, and how that affects her cash flow.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As a specialty independent contractor, ensuring positive 
                        cash flow is a combination of solid pricing,
                         simple accounting, investing in tools, and building her reputation.  
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>Pricing: Don’t cut yourself short
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>When you work in tile installation or any other building-related work,
                         you often have to balance client requirements, the costs of quality materials, 
                         and labor costs to meet the client’s budget. However, you don’t want to cut 
                         corners by providing low-quality tiles, grout, and other 
                         materials. You also don’t want to undercharge 
                        for your labor, since it can take weeks to finish a project.
                    </p>
                    <p>Remember, as a self-employed individual, you don’t have a 401(k), 
                        employer-sponsored healthcare plan, or any other traditional benefit.
                         And you pay taxes on whatever you make, so you need to keep those expenses in mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you cut corners on materials or try to undercut the competition,
                         you risk pricing yourself out of the business altogether.
                    </p>
                    <p>You’ll also want to put solid billing procedures in place. After providing an
                         estimate, Shari requires clients to purchase the materials at the beginning 
                         of the project. This ensures that she doesn’t have to worry about inventory 
                         or negative cash flow at the start of every
                         new job. She also takes an advance of 25% of labor costs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By ensuring she has some of the labor cost up-front, Shari gives herself some 
                        financial padding in case she needs to purchase new tools and for other expenses — 
                        like driving to and from the worksite and general living expenses.

                    </div>
                    <p>While Shari mentioned looking for alternative ways to keep accounting straight, 
                        for years she used templates made on Microsoft Word 
                        and printed out for <a href="/building.html">invoicing</a> and keeping track of her finances.
                    </p>
                    <p>The best program is one that you know how to use and keep track of. Some popular

                        and accounting include <a href="/building.html">Wave App,</a> <a href="/building.html">Freshbooks,</a> and <a href="/building.html">Quickbooks.</a>

                    </div>
                    <p>Perhaps one of the biggest contributors to Shari’s success and her ability 
                        to keep her cash flow management simple is her stellar reputation.
                         Her business runs almost exclusively on referrals from tile shops, 
                         suppliers, and former clients. Until now,
                         her only marketing expense has been providing business cards.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, she’s working hard to grow her online presence as well, 
                        first through cost-effective methods like networking on Facebook and local
                         small business groups. Shari’s also working on a website, which will add 
                         some smaller recurring costs, such as hosting.
                    </p>
                    <p>Through investing in her expertise and community, Shari has been able to keep
                         her marketing budget to the bare minimum—thus simplifying her accounting and
                          reserving cash flow for other recurring costs, such as travel expenses and 
                          new tools.
