                <div class="social-text">
                    <p> <a href="/building.html">Jodi Brandstetter</a> is a consultant and serial entrepreneur with over 
                        two decades of recruiting experience. In 2018, she founded a consulting 
                        firm with an emphasis on helping small and mid-sized businesses in STEM
                         hire better recruiters and talent. But after writing and marketing 
                        <a href="/building.html"> her first book on recruiting talent,</a> Jodi realized 
                        that business leaders across industries needed
                         a streamlined approach to publishing and promoting business books.
                    </p>
                    <p>Drafting, writing, and editing a book are hard enough. But C-Suite executives
                         and entrepreneurs then have to source book covers, format their book, decide
                          on distribution channels, and figure out their marketing plan. 
                          It is too easy to get lost in 
                        the process and forget about writing and publishing a book altogether.
                    </p>
                    <p>That’s why Jodi founded <a href="/building.html">Influence Network Media</a> in 2021. It’s a professional 
                        community that provides support and services for writing, publishing, and 
                        marketing books for business-leaders-turned-authors. Influence Network Media 
                        is more than a passion project—it’s a business in its own right.
                    </p>
                    <p>We interviewed Jodi on the Cash Flow Show to learn how she started her network business from scratch.</p>

                        <h2>What is a network business?
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p> A network business is more than a forum or group, although many successful network 
                        platforms start off this way. Influence Network Media offers a combination of a 
                        free group, paid courses, and “do-it-for-you” concierge services. The free group 
                        provides access to a community of fellow business writers and
                         supporters, while book production services are bundled into packages.
                    </p>
                    <p>Setting up a second business with so many social elements can be time-consuming. 
                        For that reason, Jodi decided to bring on a partner. This would allow her to better
                         balance her consulting business with the network and bring another set of skills
                          into the business.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I made that decision to find a partner who actually complements me,” says Jodi.
                         “So I'm more of the Chief Operating Officer, and she is more the business development side.
                         So we work well together in that perspective.”
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">

                        <h2>From free to monetized services
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Inside the free Influence Network Media group, potential clients can ask questions,
                         interact with Jodi and her team, and meet with other business leaders. 
                        This both qualifies leads and gives the group and the network more authority.
                    </p>
                    <p>These clients can choose to then buy a guided course to write, edit, publish,
                         and market their book. Courses start at $799 and help clients 
                        figure out the perfect headshot to becoming a bestseller on Amazon.
                    </p>
                    <p>Jodi outsources to independent contractors for work like design, book editing,
                         ghostwriting, and other tasks. She also coaches authors who want hands-on 
                         experience.

                         accounts for my first business over time so that I could bucket my money.
                          I now have one savings account
                         that's just for taxes, and I have another one for a rainy day.”

                        service, which is unique. In this service, an author can choose to take 
                        ownership over one chapter in a multi-author book. This can be extremely useful
                        for influencers who are not ready to write a 
                        whole book but still want to expand their thought leadership.
                    </p>
                    <p>If they want more assistance, potential clients can also choose to contact her 
                        team for a concierge service based on their budget. Jodi and her team will then 
                        locate ghostwriters, cover designers, and other professionals to get the book finished.
                         The team can also help with market efforts, such as 
                        arranging podcast interviews, press releases, and other events.

                        <h2>Strategic money management between businesses
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>If there’s one thing Jodi appreciates, it’s keeping expenses down. She uses
                         several inexpensive or free applications to keep meticulous business records. For example, she uses
                        <a href="/building.html"> Wave app </a> for invoicing, which is a free application for small businesses.
                    </p>
                    <p>To keep her business accounts organized, Jodi keeps a separate account for each
                         business, each at completely different financial institutions. This makes it 
                         easy to separate the accounts mentally and prevents her from 
                        using her consulting account for her network business and vice versa.
                    </p>
                    <p>“When I started my consulting business, I started with just a checking account and
                         a business credit card,” notes Jodi. “And then I added accounts for my first 
                         business overtime so that I could bucket my money. I now have one savings
                         account that's just for taxes, and I have another one for a rainy day.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Currently, she budgets about 5% of her income for 
                        emergencies but plans to expand it to 10% post-pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <p>Since Influence Network Media is so new, she only has a single 
                        checking account and credit card. But as the business grows, 
                        Jodi plans to add more “bucket” accounts to separate items
                         like taxes and expenses.
                    </p>
                    <p>The biggest tip Jodi has for entrepreneurs? Know your strengths and weaknesses and
                         reserve your cash for services or tools that complement those weaknesses.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, Jodi says that she’s not nearly as good at creating advertising and 
                        marketing materials as she is at running operations. For that reason, Jodi
                         prefers to spend on marketing and advertising but handles other aspects of 
                         the company herself, such as accounting, networking, and other high-level tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>This cash flow strategy helps her keep a low overhead and 
                        retain more income, without doing everything herself.
