                        those pretty hardwood floors lead to more signed contracts? Businesses 
                        like <a href="/building.html">Happy Cog</a> have transitioned to 
                        a distributed office, and they are still just as effective.

                    <p>In fact, the <a href="/building.html">latest research shows</a> that half of all employees will work 
                        from home by 2020. If giving up your office is an option, you can work
                         with your team by using technology like Skype, Slack and Google Hangouts
                          and rent a conference room when you need to meet face to face.
