                <div class="social-text">
                    <p><a href="building.html">Ryan David</a> had already suffered two layoffs when he was confronted with losing his
                         job a third time in 2017. Despite his stellar background and passion for customer 
                         service, Ryan found himself struggling to hold onto a steady job. Broke, 
                        with a family to support, he knew something had to change.
                    </p>
                    <p>When his brother-in-law handed him a copy of Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki, 
                        Ryan began to realize what was missing. Three hundred pages later, Ryan had his 
                        heart set on fusing his passion for helping others with building a real 
                        estate business. At the very right moment of time, <a href="building.html">We Buy Houses Pennsylvania</a> was born.
                    </p>
                    <p>In our recent episode of the Cash Flow Show, we spoke with Ryan 
                         learn more about how he started and grew his business.

                <div class="social-text">            
                    <p>As you can imagine, control over your cash flow is fundamental for anyone 
                        interested in making money through real estate. House buyers and rental companies 
                        looking to invest in property need money upfront for home purchases, maintenance, 
                        restoration, or refurbishing their new property and marketing it.
                    </p>
                    <p>All of this means that real estate professionals juggle multiple activities—from ensuring 
                        strong vendor relationships to meeting clients, vetting tenants,
                         and possibly reviewing new potential investments.

                        <h2>Challenges with cash flow in real estate</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Buying and selling real estate is expensive. It requires a significant upfront investment.
                         You may need several thousand dollars to 
                        purchase your first flip or rental to get started.
                    </p>
                    <p>Whether you choose to sell your investment or rent it out, you also need to consider
                        long-term costs. Common expenses include:
                    </p>
                    <p> <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Utilities<br>

                    <p>You'll also need to understand and prepare for housing market fluctuations. 
                        When prices bottom out, it’s possible to go through dry spells. That’s why it’s 
                        critical to set aside a cash reserve. Ryan and his partner set 30% of funds aside 
                        for repairs, vacancy management, expenses, and significant, unexpected costs. For 
                        most projects, they end up using 10-20% of this buffer fund.

                        <h2>Scaling your business with year-to-year projections</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Despite starting the business during the pandemic, Ryan has bought and sold dozens of 
                        properties, and We Buy Houses is now one of the top three organizations in its market.
                         He says the three
                         following strategies are critical to scale like they did: 
                    </p>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Keep your overhead lean<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Create key relationships with suppliers<br>

                    </p>
                    <p>At We Buy Houses, Ryan has kept overhead as small as possible by limiting headcount to 
                        just himself and his partner. In lieu of a large team, Ryan has established strategic
                         relationships with other house buyers and investors in other areas.
                         This has created a referral system that brings a steady flow of leads.
                    </p>  
                </div>

                <div class="schooling">
                   <h4>
                    “We have had investors reach out to us from other markets with leads that are useless 
                    to them but are very valuable to us. So we give them a flat percentage on the 
                    leads we close,” says Ryan. “And that is a really great win-win.”   
                   </h4>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    
                    <p> In a hot market, the business can appear to grow quickly. But in this scenario, 
                        maintaining inventory can be tough, which can limit your ability to scale. When 
                        properties sell too quickly, it becomes harder to preserve a list of valuable homes. 
                        It’s also essential to consider potential dips in the market. Ryan uses cash flow 
                        projections to stay on track and flexible during market shifts.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Especially after COVID, we only look at year-to-year projections. That gives us 
                        enough headway to know what’s going on, but not too much, in case the bottom falls 
                        out of the market,” says Ryan.

                    <p>Before buying any property, Ryan and his partner use spreadsheets to determine the 
                        net value of a property and decide what to do with their potential investment. 
                        They use this calculator to determine if a 
                        property would be best as a rental property, a rehab, or a flip:

                    <p>Ryan has broken down his calculation further to hash out his max offers, flip costs,
                         repair costs, potential cash flow, profit, and down payments. These items provide 
                         analytical insight into the value of an investment and give him 
                        a blueprint for how much cash to invest in each property.
                    </p>
                    <p>Note that profit and cash flow are differentiated here. Profit is remaining revenue 
                        after all expenses. Cash flow represents cash coming in and out of his business. 
                        While making a profit can be an indicator of good health, cash flow helps you 
                        understand where your money is going and how sustainable your business is.
                    </p>
                    <p>“In a nutshell, this simple calculator that my mentor and I built teaches us so much,
                         because just by plugging the numbers in, it can tell us exactly what we can do with the property, 
                        how much we should pay, and what it will produce,” says Ryan.
                    </p>
                    <p>Detailed calculators like this one can significantly reduce the risk of overspending while providing
                         a plan of action for each property.
