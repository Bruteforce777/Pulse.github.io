                    <p>Sick of the feast and famine cycle? Creative agencies are especially prone to 
                        <a href="/building.html"> months of reduced cash flow.</a>However, it’s 
                        possible for agency owners to create a predictable income stream.
                    </p>
                    <p>In a recent episode of the Harvard Business Review Podcast, <a href="/building.html">Every Business</a>
                          <a href="/building.html">Can Be a Subscription Business,</a> Strategy Consultant Robbie Kellman Baxter, explained
                          the many benefits of adding a subscription service to your business. Baxter 
                          emphasized that subscription models create predictable revenue, are great for 
                          cash flow, planning with confidence, and company valuation.
                    </p>
                    <p>Subscription pricing models are increasingly becoming the norm. According to the Global 
                        Banking and Finance Review, <a href="/building.html">70% of business leaders</a> consider subscription pricing the key 
                        to finding and retaining clients. In fact, businesses without annual contracts or subscriptions 
                        typically lose customers at a rate of 9%. The rate for businesses with at least 75% 
                        of their revenue running on recurring revenue? Only 3%.
                    </p>
                    <p>Better client relations aside, subscriptions can provide creative agencies with the stability 
                        and flexibility to grow. Keep reading to find out how these models work
                         and how to design your own subscription model below:

                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Nowadays, most of us are familiar with the subscription model. From Netflix to newspapers, 
                        setting aside a small fee for regular services has become essential 
                        in our daily lives. Why should business be any different?
                    </p>
                    <p>To put it simply, a subscription model allows you to charge a client a regular 
                        amount every month for a set of predetermined services. Similar to a retainer, 
                        it automates payment and pricing negotiation by simplifying it for both parties.

                    <p>For creative agencies, adding or shifting completely to a subscription model can save
                        you time while maintaining or improving your profits.
                    </p>
                    <p>First and foremost, subscriptions translate into <a href="/building.html">predictable cash flow </a>and higher client
                         retention. Think about it: If your client subscribes to one of your packages for three 
                         or six months, perhaps even a year, you have a stable income from that client. You don’t
                          need to worry each month 
                        how many services they want and what their budget is.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the same time, you save on man-hours by reducing your administrative tasks.
                         You can even use this freed 
                        up time to upsell your clients and focus on growth.

                    <p>It’s easy to say subscription models are ideal. While they bring big benefits to
                         agencies and creative professionals, you do need to onboard clients. Here’s our 
                        step-by-step process of setting up your subscription strategy.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>1. Review current services and cash flow
                    </h2>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                   
                    <p>Before you do anything else you need to take stock of your processes and <a href="/building.html">your cash flow.</a> 
                        Documenting your services, work hours, income, expenses, and goals will help you determine how you can
                         optimize your proposed packages and sell them more easily.
                    </p>
                    <p>Most likely you are creating custom quotes per project and establishing a payment schedule based
                         on milestones. To shift to a subscription-based pricing plan, you need to pinpoint where you
                          are creating the most value and 
                        carefully calculate how many hours each service takes.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some questions to ask yourself are:</p>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Which services need regular maintenance?<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> What are your client’s pain points? Is there an additional service you can offer them?<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> How long does each service take?<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Which services go well together?<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> What is your minimum income goal?<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> What expenses are essential and non-essential?<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> How many hours can you work a week, counting vacation and sick days?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>2. Plan your core subscriptions
                    </h2>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                   
                    <p>The next step is to create your subscription packages. Here you will begin adding 
                        services into a bundle that makes sense for your client’s needs. For example,
                        if you run a UX design agency, you may want to create a bundle that includes regular 
                        site maintenance to ensure that a software update doesn’t alter the design. Or you may
                         provide ongoing graphic design options for clients 
                        who have bought a branding identity or website redesign.
                    </p>
                    <p>This can also work in the reverse. If you get a subscription for regular graphic design work,
                         you can provide discounts on your on-time projects 
                        just as a website redesign or branding kits
                    </p>
                    <p>You may also choose to hire another contractor or part-time employee to provide services
                         that would complement your normal offerings. If we continue with the design agency example, 
                         you could include social media services 
                        as part of a complete brand management package.
                    </p>
                    <p>Regardless of how you set up your core and additional services, you need to ensure that
                         you’ve accurately estimated the value of your 
                        time and how you will be able to juggle multiple projects.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>3. Test your pricing
                    </h2>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    
                    <p>Next, you’ll want to test your pricing to ensure that it makes sense. You don’t want to scare
                         off potential customers but you 
                        also don’t want to leave money on the table.
                    </p>
                    <p>To do this, try sending out a proposal to your past clients letting them know about the new 
                        model you are introducing at an estimated price point. If you get so much positive feedback 
                        that they’ve all signed up—you may be pricing yourself too low and should raise the prices for
                         new clients. If you get little to no feedback or repeated questions 
                        about getting a discount, your packages are priced too high.
                    </p>
                    <p>The payoff, if you can correctly build and price your packages, is that you no longer have 
                        to worry about projects dropping off the map after one milestone or waiting 30 plus days 
                        for payment. Your new subscription model will generate a steady stream of revenue 
                        on a regular basis and send out automatic invoices.

                    </p>
                    <p>With more predictable revenue, you can figure out if you need to invest in 
                        time-saving software or begin outsourcing more tasks and smaller services. 
                        You can also look at how you can upsell higher-priced or seasonal items—like 
                        annual website audits—to your subscribers.

                    <p>Once you’ve been using the model for at least three months, you should be able to
                         understand where you need to tweak either your model or your marketing and 
                         make adjustments appropriately. Be sure to collect feedback and testimonials as 
                         well. You can use these to show potential 
                        customers how effective your model is for their business.
                    </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, you need to not only consider client satisfaction but also whether 
                        you are meeting your own goals. Are you making as much as you wanted? If not, how 
                        can you improve? How many hours are you working? Are there any packages 
                        that are taking far more time than you accounted for?
