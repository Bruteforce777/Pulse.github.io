                    <p> Startups of all stripes struggle with cash flow. Even fintech startups can fall 
                        into common financing traps such as overspending, lack of oversight, and poor support 
                        for their accounting team.
                    </p>
                    <p>As it stands, up to <a href="/building.html">75%</a> of venture-backed startups shut their doors within their first
                         year. Negative cash flow
                         issues are one of the top reasons these businesses fail.

                    <p>To learn more about successful fintech <a href="/building.html">startup</a> cash flow management, we spoke with

                          including Automatic, which was acquired by SiriusXM for $115M in 2016.

                    <p> In this discussion (check out the video—it’s a great conversation about his experiences 
                        in the industry), Thejo offered up insights on cash flow that
                        we’ve narrowed down to three major tips for fintech startups:

                        <h2>1. Prioritize Accounting as More Than Crunching Numbers
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p> Businesses can’t do anything without capital. Unfortunately, it’s common for 
                        businesses to unintentionally handicap their accounting team. This can sabotage 
                        their business and result in inaccurate finance reports. Often, finance professionals
                         are burdened with manual tasks, like data entry. Poor reporting or communication 
                         across departments can slow and confuse cash flow reporting.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Unfortunately, finance and accounting teams tend to get pushed into a role of
                         glorified data entry people during the first week of every month—largely
                         because of a failure of the tools they are expected to use,” says Thejo.
                    </p>
                    <p>When this happens, your accounting team wastes time and energy on tasks that don’t 
                        further business objectives. And because they lack visibility about finances and how 
                        they relate to the company and department goals, cash flow <a href="/building.html">projection</a> becomes difficult,
                         if not impossible.

                        without hassle.

                    </div>
                    <p>While Google Sheets may work for a small, budding business, it’s often not a good long-term
                         strategy, especially if you’re scaling quickly. Not only do you need to manually update
                          the sheet regularly, but it has limited project and reporting capabilities. Furthermore,
                           it can get overloaded and confused
                         quickly when multiple employees are working on the document. 
                    </p>
                    <p>When it comes to selecting the best cash flow management platform, you need to focus on a 
                        solution that provides usability, visibility, transparency, and collaboration.
                    </p>
                    <p>“If you put in place a system which allows every individual to ask and answer the 
                        questions of how they are spending company money and how much they are spending, 
                        then it is so much easier
                         to create a culture of accountability and hold on to more cash,” says Thejo.
                    </p>
                    <p>Not only should you be able to quickly adjust your income
                         or expenses, but you should also be able to:

                    <p>Thejo explains that without the proper tools your accounting team will end up
                         focused on oversight, fixing errors, and scrambling to find out why money is 
                         being spent.

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>It’s important to keep in mind that your cash flow management needs can 
                        change once you become more established and your company grows. 
                        Even with a solid foundation, you may need to update your technology. 
                    </p>
                    <p>At this point, you’ll need to decide when to prioritize a migration to a new cash flow
                         management program. If you are scaling rapidly, 
                        it makes sense to migrate away from silos and automate more tasks as soon as possible.

                    <p> Tracking income in and out is foundational, but using that data to create
                         cash flow <a href="/building.html">projections</a> is where a startup can up their chances of survival. 
                         Forecasting allows you to understand your cash flow further in the future and can help you
                         make decisions—such as when to invest in new equipment or seek funding.
                    </p>
                    <p>You’ll want to ask yourself a number of questions as you review your cash flow reports. 
                        Thejo recommends these key considerations:
                    </p>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> What are the levers that highlight growth?<br>

                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Why do we think we can do that?<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> What inputs need to go in for sales hiring, marketing spend, and so on for us to meet our objective?
                    </p>
                    <p>Clear and detailed cash flow reports make answering these questions easier. 
                        And the transparency will help you better forecast your future cash flow.

                         to cash flow management, even as the tech available
