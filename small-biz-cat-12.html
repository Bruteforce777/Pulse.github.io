                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>A fellow digital agency owner recently shared some advice he got from
                         his business mentor with me. The advice lays out what
                         numbers really matter when tracking the value and health of your business.
                    </p>
                    <p>I recently attended <a href="/building.html">Owner Camp 007,</a> where fellow digital agency owners celebrated,
                        commiserated and discussed what it takes to stay sane while running our businesses.
                         Afterwards, all of the alumni have kept in touch over <a href="/building.html">Basecamp</a> to continue the 
                         conversation. These discussions are already
                         the source some of the most helpful business advice I've ever received.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>Financial Ratios
                    </h2>
                </div>       
                
                <div class="social-text">
                      
                    <p> One piece of such advice came from a story that Adam Landrum, who runs <a href="/building.html">Up&Up,</a>
                         shared with me. With his permission, I'm sharing it here. The advice centered
                          on the concept of the financial ratios for a business, 
                        or in other words, what percent of your budget should go to X, Y and Z.
                    </p>
                    <p>As the story goes, Adam was presenting a budget to his business mentor for 
                        critique, a budget with more than 20 line items. The mentor (who is highly 
                        skilled in evaluating the business side of creative agencies) put his hand
                         on Adam's shoulder as if to say, "That's cute". He turned the paper over
                          and wrote down the 
                        following list of line items that he felt were the most worth tracking:
                    </p>
                    
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Compensation<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Net Profit<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Advertising and Marketing<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Rent<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> General and Administrative
                    </p>
                    <p>Then, he wrote what the percentage of each item should be in a 
                        healthy creative agency. He started with compensation and profit:
                    </p>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Compensation: 58%<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Net Profit: 20%
                    </p>
                    <p>The thing to note here is that this totals to 78 percent, which means your 
                        business must operate off of the remaining 22 percent. 
                        The rest breaks down as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Advertising and Marketing: 5%<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Rent: 6%<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> General and Administrative: 11%
                    </p>
                    <p>While these numbers can be fluid and different for every agency, 
                        the most important number to watch is profit, which always has to
                         stay at 20 percent or above. If you don't spend much on advertising
                          and marketing, perhaps you can afford to spend more on compensation.
                           In a city like Memphis, Tenn., where <a href="/building.html">Simple Focus'</a> office is located, 
                           the cost of living is very low, so our compensation and rent can come in low, which means 
                        we can spend more on administrative expenses or keep more in profits.
                    </p>
                    <p>These numbers will always wind up equalling 100 percent. As long as your 
                        profit remains above 20 percent, your business is in good shape.
                    </p>
