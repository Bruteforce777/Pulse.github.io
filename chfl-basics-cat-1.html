                    <p> Any startup needs to remember that cash flow trumps growth. In 2017,
                         at least 70% of startups <a href="/building.html">failed to get funding.</a> It wasn’t because they weren’t growing,
                         but rather because they could not maintain positive cash flow.
                    </p>
                    <p>Thriving small businesses and fintech startups use cash flow to their 
                        advantage. We spoke with <a href="/building.html">Colin Gerber,</a> Senior Director of Revenue Operations 
                        and Strategy at <a href="/building.html">Very Good Security (VGS), </a>to find out more about how you can balance cash flow 
                        management with growth expectations and create feasible sales goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>VGS provides compliance and data security as a service. As a <a href="/building.html">fintech startup,</a>
                         VGS makes data security and compliance a streamlined effort for small businesses
                          and enterprise companies alike. Their unique approach
                         to compliance saves companies up to 70% of compliance costs.
                    </p>

                        <h2>Align investments with long-term goals
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p> When it comes to early-growth companies, the team must be cash conscious if 
                        they want to accurately align their funding with achieving long-term stability.
                    </p>
                    <p>"As an early-stage company, we are cash-conscious since we are raising money,” 
                        says Colin. “At this point, startups need investments upfront.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Early-stage companies need upfront investments in the short term to build a 
                        stable workforce and achieve long-term growth. In the beginning, it’s common 
                        for startups to rapidly grow their team to handle client needs and drive revenue. 
                        Startups in this early stage cycle should see spikes in hiring that correlate with 
                        more sales, usually above 
                        industry average benchmarks. But this short-term growth can quickly peter out.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="schooling">
                    <h4>"A key indicator to look at is your payback period. If you are scaling sustainability,
                         you should see your payback period decreasing. For example,
                          VGS is currently paying back investments 
                        at 20 months and will soon close in on the industry standard of 12 months."
                    </h4>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>Startups need to invest in headcount, resources, and other necessary 
                        frameworks to prepare for the long-term sales cycles. While sales and 
                        hiring spikes should decrease over time as the business aligns 
                        with the industry benchmarks, 
                        client lifetime value should increase as you get more repeat customers.
                    </p>
                    <p>"A key indicator to look at is your payback period. If you are scaling sustainability, 
                        you should see your payback period decreasing. For example,

                    </p>
                    <p>Of course, your timeline might be different if you need to pivot or find another
                         market to sell to. It will also depend on the size of your clients. Selling to
                          mid-market commercial businesses will generate faster sales cycles. 
                          But enterprise clients can easily take up half a
                         year to close a deal, and they typically request more resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ideally, you’ll want to balance these two types of clients to 
                        optimize your positive cash flow and sustain long-term growth.
                    </p>
                    <p>“It’s important to keep raising the bar to service larger and larger clients,” 
                        says Colin. “You want to <a href="/building.html">scale </a>your organizations for 1:1 growth.
                         Try to get a flywheel effect so 
                        that you can get more revenue from every new head as your team grows.”
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="social-text">

                        <h2>Balance expenses
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Next, you’ll want to look at your expenses and align budgets appropriately
                    </p>
                    <p>This can mean regularly reviewing tools,
                        your hiring process, and whether you are accounting for taxes and other expenses.
                    </p>
                    <p>“If we negotiate with external parties, we always are cash-flow conscious. 
                        Instead of annual upfront, we make quarterly contracts,” 
                        says Colin. “We are always watching our runway and balancing the inflow-outflow.”
                    </p>
                    <p>It’s also essential to have thorough cash flow models. You’ll want to go in-depth 
                        in reviewing your budget and expenditures. But you always want to look at how 
                        you are building revenue. You’ll want to analyze your customers and how much
                         you make from each sale. You can then connect this information with 
                        specific product lines and segments to fine-tune your data.
                    </p>
                    <p>After all of this, you’ll want to work backward to account for your sales and marketing
                         teams and assign applicable quotas. 
                    </p>

                        <h2>Determine your pricing
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Pricing is another major concern, and it largely 
                        depends on your product type. But it can often
                        help to diversify your pricing set up depending on your services.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, VGS offers a subscription service for its data Vault and 
                        compliance services. The team analyzed their costs concerning the 
                        required AWS hosting, engineer headcount,
                         and maintenance expenses to price this subscription appropriately.
                    </p>
                    <p>Non-recurring costs—such as third-party audits or penetration tests—require 
                        specific quotes since the headcount increases.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, in both cases, VGS ensures that its pricing adheres to industry benchmarks.
                         This keeps them competitive without undercutting the industry or their services.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    </div>
                    <p>Another key for startups is linking cash flow <a href="/building.html">forecasts</a> 
                        to realistic goals for their sales team.
                    </p>
                    <p>“For early-stage startups, forecasting is often aspirational,”
                         says Colin. “You need to look at KPIs that can inform your headcount.”
                    </p>
                    <p>This includes working on productivity assumptions. If you can
                        determine your team’s productivity level, the approximate number
                         of bookings, and customer segmentation outlook, you can get a better 
                        idea about what’s feasible from a sales standpoint.
                    </p>
                    <p>You want to be able to connect cash flow with relevant goals. 
                        That way, you can forecast accurately
                         without setting unachievable expectations.
