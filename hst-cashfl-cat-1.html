                         nearly two decades providing

                    <p>As a specialty independent contractor, ensuring positive cash flow is a combination of solid pricing,
                         simple accounting, investing in tools, and building her reputation.
                    </p>
                </div>

                        <h2>Pricing: Don’t cut yourself short
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>When you work in tile installation or any other building-related work, you 
                        often have to balance client requirements, the costs of quality materials, 
                        and labor costs to meet the client’s budget. However, you don’t want to cut
                        corners by providing low-quality tiles, grout, and other materials. You also don’t want to 
                        undercharge for your labor, since it can take weeks to finish a project.
                    </p>
                    <p>Remember, as a self-employed individual, you don’t have a 401(k), employer-sponsored 
                        healthcare plan, or any other traditional benefit. And you pay taxes on whatever
                         you make, so you need to keep those expenses in mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you cut corners on materials or try to undercut the competition, 
                        you risk pricing yourself out of the business altogether.
                    </p>
                    <p>You’ll also want to put solid billing procedures in place. After providing an estimate,
                         Shari requires clients to purchase the materials at the beginning of the project. 
                         This ensures that she doesn’t have to worry about inventory or negative cash flow 
                         at the start of every new job.
                         She also takes an advance of 25% of labor costs.
                    </p>
                    <p>By ensuring she has some of the labor cost up-front, Shari gives herself some 
                        financial padding in case she needs to purchase new tools and for other expenses — 
                        like driving to and from the worksite and general living expenses.

                    <p>While Shari mentioned looking for alternative ways to keep accounting straight, 
                        for years she used templates made on Microsoft Word and printed

                    <p>Perhaps one of the biggest contributors to Shari’s success and her ability 
                         keep her cash flow management simple is her stellar reputation. Her business 
                         runs almost exclusively on referrals from tile shops,
                          suppliers, and former clients. Until now, 
                        her only marketing expense has been providing business cards.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, she’s working hard to grow her online presence as well, first
                         through cost-effective methods like networking on Facebook and local 
                         small business groups. Shari’s also working 
                        on a website, which will add some smaller recurring costs, such as hosting.
                    </p>
                    <p>Through investing in her expertise and community, Shari has been able to keep
                         her marketing budget to the bare minimum—thus simplifying her 
                         accounting and reserving cash flow 
                        for other recurring costs, such as travel expenses and new tools.
