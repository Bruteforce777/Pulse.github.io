                </h2>

            </div>

                    <img src="woman3.jpeg">
                </div>
    
                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>For a <a href="/building.html">small business owner,</a> it’s an excellent opportunity to examine
                         past successes and failures and to move forward with your business
                          in the most predictable and profitable manner possible. Understanding
                           how cash flow affects your
                         business is a great step in maximizing your business’s potential.
                    </p>
                    <p>Cash flow is the total money moving in and out of your business.
                         A business with a high volume of cash flow isn’t necessarily 
                        successful unless that cash flow is positive.
                    </p>
                    <p>Take for example a graphic designer who runs his own business.
                        He receives revenue from multiple clients for contracted work,
                         and his regular expenses include rent and utilities for a small 
                         office, advertising, a monthly fee for software and a few freelancers he occasionally hires.
                         He keeps careful track of his income and expenses using a spreadsheet.
                    </p>
                    <p>If he were to lose one of his contracts, he doesn’t know what 
                        impact it would have on his bottom line going forward
                    </p>
                    <p>If he were to use cash flow software like <a href="/building.html">Pulse,</a> he would be able to consult 
                        his projections for the upcoming months to see how this loss will impact his
                         business’s cash flow in the immediate future. By learning from his past 
                         cash flow and projecting future cash flow, he will better be able to 
                         decide if he needs to make cutbacks in advertising or hiring 
                        freelancers in order to keep his net cash flow positive.
                    </p>
                    <p>Pulse is designed to make it easy for <a href="/building.html">small business owners</a> like you 
                        to keep your eyes on the horizon of your money management. Do you intend to
                         give your employees a Christmas bonus? Pulse can help you know when it’s 
                         smart to save towards that goal. Expecting a lull in business during the 
                         winter months? Pulse can keep you on track to meet your financial goals 
                         through quarter one and beyond by giving you a better estimate of future 
                         revenue. Planning a resource intensive project? Pulse can help you estimate
                          how this will affect your bottom line for each week of the coming year.
                    </p>
                    <p>In short, cash flow projection helps you make better business decisions.</p>

                    <p>As another example, what if your business hits a sudden wall? Maybe unfortunate
                         circumstances force you to close up shop for a few days. With detailed 
                         <a href="/building.html"> cash flow projections,</a> you will have a better idea of how long it will take to 
                         recover those losses and get you back on track. This will allow you to 
                         spend money more wisely in the meantime.
                    </p>
                    <p>Perhaps a sudden rush of business leaves you with more cash on hand than 
                        expected. With Pulse, you can consult your projections and decide if this 
                        extra revenue is better spent trying to maintain 
                        your good fortune, or is best saved for an upcoming expense.
                    </p>
                    <p>This year, resolve to make better business decisions. Stop spending money
                         you don’t have on stuff you don’t need. Stop using that time-consuming 
                         spreadsheet that only shows you money 
                        from the past. You’re better than a spreadsheet.
                    </p>

                        <p>When we bought Pulse in October of 2013, it had been a flat business for three years.
                             I knew the previous owners personally and knew they hadn't neglected Pulse,
                             but they weren't actively building new features, either.
