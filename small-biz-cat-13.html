                    <p>After establishing a track record of success and profit, many businesses 
                        work with a bank to secure a line of credit. Businesses may want a line 
                        of credit in case they find themselves waiting on a big check, but they
                         may also take advantage of it if there's an opportunity that's too good 
                         to pass up, such as acquiring a 
                        competitor or investing in a new technology that will grow their business.
                    </p>
                    <p>Here's the thing, though: banks want to give you money when you don't 
                        need it, so be sure to get your line of credit when things are going well.
                         A month's worth of expenses is a good amount to shoot for.

                    <p>Sometimes, your cash flow can be quickened by simply allowing your 
                        customers to pay you online. Many invoicing platforms have online payments 
                        built in. Here are some of our favorites:

                        This is what our parent company, Simple Focus, is currently using to track time and send invoices. It's super easy to use.<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> <a href="/building.html">Freshbooks</a><br>
                        This is what Simple Focus used to use. It's great for small, growing businesses who want to look professional and streamline invoicing.<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> <a href="/building.html">Quickbooks Online</a><br>
                        Yuck, right? As an industry giant, we have to include them, and they did just redesign their online product (it's actually not that bad).<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i>  <a href="/building.html">Less Accounting</a><br>
                        We're friends with these guys and Simple Focus designed their logo. They have super friendly customer service and a recently redesigned product.
                    </p>
                    <p>There are other great options out there, too. These are just the ones we've used.</p>

                    <p>Another way to improve cash flow is by reducing your receivables.
                         Regardless of what you've been told, it's entirely possible to 
                         negotiate for upfront payments in the service industry. On larger projects,
                         you can still break payments into milestones, 
                        but put them in front of the work rather than behind it.
                    </p>
                    <p>And yes, big companies are willing to negotiate their payments terms,
                         even with small businesses. You won't get it if you don't ask for it.

                    <p>Sometimes, we all just accept that wasted expenses are a part of business.
                         But, we don't have to accept that. One of the most obvious ways to 
                         improve your cash flow position is to look for places where you business 
                        is spending unnecessary money and simply stop spending that money.
                    </p>
                    <p>One quick method is to go down your credit card and bank statements and look
                        for recurring fees for things you don't use any more. In addition to this
                         super simple method, there are also some great tools for 
                        automatically analyzing your expenses. Here are some of our favorites:
