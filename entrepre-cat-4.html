                    <p>(Read <a href="/building.html">this article,</a> and you can thank us later when
                         you decide to sell for $20 million instead of $200 million.)
                    </p>
                    <p>In the meantime, as a founder, you’re responsible for paying bills,
                         handling payroll and keeping the lights on—whether or not you
                         consider yourself a
                         “numbers person” that enjoys fiddling with spreadsheets.
                    </p>
                    <p>You probably aren’t, and you probably don’t. You probably excel at 
                        software architecture, product development or sales. But your investors will 
                        expect to see your cash flow projections from time to time.
                    </p>
                    <p>When it comes to outside funding, the devil in the details either
                         builds your credibility or hurts it.
                    </p>
                    <p>So how can you stay on top of your cash flow projections?</p>
                    <p>Here are six tips to help you take control of your cash flow:</p>

                    <p> <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i><span class="highlights">1. Download a free cash flow template.</span> You can find a 12-month version
                         here and 3-year version here. Better yet, use Pulse to give your 
                         projects that professional polish that spreadsheets lack. Pulse is
                          also better for sharing visual cash flow and collaborating with mentors and
                           investors. <a href="/building.html">Spreadsheets</a> are perfectly acceptable, of course, but Pulse offers another,
                            more subtle benefit: 
                        building trust by showing that you’re savvy.
                    </p>
                    <p> <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i><span class="highlights">2. Create your sales forecast.</span> 
                        A good rule of thumb is to create three different
                         projections: conservative, moderate, and aggressive.
                    </p>
                    <p> <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i><span class="highlights"> 3. Estimate your expenses.</span> 
                        If your business is already up and running, plug in your past numbers.
                         If you haven’t opened the doors yet, you may have overlooked certain 
                         sneaky, variable expenses like office cleaning, travel, tax work and 
                         LLC fees. It’s those little things that can get you, so sit down with a 
                         veteran entrepreneur. Ask him or her to help you identify 
                        likely expenses that you missed and poke holes in your projections.
                    </p>
                    <p> <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i><span class="highlights">
                        4. Plug in as much past data as you can–past, present, and future. </span> 
                        Fair warning: This may take you awhile. If you start to go cross-eyed or get
                         frustrated, come back to the task tomorrow. Ask for help 
                        from your accountant. Ask for help from your mentors and advisors.
                    </p>

                        5. Commit to a monthly review—at a minimum.</span> 
                        Pick a day each month, sit down with your co-founders, and run your actual numbers.
                         Schedule it like you would any other mission-critical meeting. If you’re 
                         not outsourcing your bookkeeping to <a href="/building.html">someone else,</a> then the buck stops with you.
                        Throwing receipts in a shoebox won’t cut it. Update your actual numbers
                        and compare them to your projections. Pulse makes this pretty easy;
                        <a href="/building.html">this blog post </a> will walk you through the steps. Once you know where you stand, you
                         can develop a plan of attack and delegate responsibilities.

                        6. Don’t let profits lull you to sleep. </span> 
                        Your P&L Statement may look squeaky clean. But don’t let being in the black deceive you. 
                        <a href="/building.html"> You can be on budget and profitable AND still be broke.</a> Do you have cash reserves?
                         Ninety days’ worth of operating expenses is worth considering while you’re

                         expense? What about the talented Rails developer who moves on to a cushier gig? 
                         A contractor who fills in may cost you
                         more per hour than your W-2 employee and skew your numbers.
