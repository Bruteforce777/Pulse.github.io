                    <p> While there are many uncertainties for businesses during and after COVID-19,
                         one thing is clear: Many businesses need to change or risk failure. By the end 
                         of March, <a href="/building.html">60 major retailers</a>—with more than 50,000 physical retail locations— had
                          closed temporarily and a survey from Main Street America concluded that
                          <a href="/building.html"> 7.5 million businesses</a> were at risk of permanent closure. 
                        While consumers are spending less overall, they are buying up to <a href="/building.html">30% more online.     
                        </a>
                    </p>
                    <p>As more and more states allow businesses to reopen, albeit, with nuanced restrictions, 
                        it’s not quite business as usual. In order to stay afloat, many small businesses had 
                        to innovate and find a way to survive in this new normal. From shifting online to 
                        readjusting their cash flow,
                         business owners have drastically changed their operations.
                    </p>
                    <p>Going forward, business owners will have to continue to strive to find new ways to 
                        connect with consumers on increasingly tight budgets.
                         The good news? There are many creative methods to consider.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>The key to survival for businesses is ensuring cash flow into the business. This
                         alone has driven companies to find ways to continue to serve customers despite 
                         lockdowns. For retail shops, this can mean turning to eCommerce or curbside pickups. 
                         For restaurants, this has resulted in taking online orders, 
                        increasing takeaway meals, or offering home deliveries. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Consumers are likely to be on guard and less interested in going out. So the easier
                         you can make the delivery, the better. Not only is this approach customer-focused,
                          but it will reduce foot traffic at your physical location without sacrificing 
                          revenue. For businesses required to operate at 25% or 50% capacity,
                         changing up how you deliver your final product can level the playing field.
                    </p>
                    <p>For those concerned with handling limited capacity, you can consider creating a 
                        pre-paid reservation system to make everything run smoothly. <a href="/building.html">Black Sheep Restaurant </a> 
                         in Hong Kong has created a <a href="/building.html">COVID-19 Playbook</a> that 
                        details all of their procedures from delivery to cost management.

                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p> For many retailers, adding an eCommerce option can allow them to move inventory,
                        increase cash reserves, and reconnect with customers.
                         But opening an online store isn’t the only way to boost cash flow.
                    </p>
                    <p>Events that might have been held live on location can be turned into exclusive live
                         streams. Take online fitness lessons as an example. Many fitness businesses, 
                         such as Downtown Yoga in Memphis, Tennessee, have turned to virtual sessions to
                          revive their revenue streams. For other service-oriented businesses,
                         you can offer free or discounted consultations through Zoom or Skype.
                    </p>
                    <p>Expanding your digital marketing plan is another way of using social distancing to
                         your advantage. You can invest in content marketing with blogs, email lists, 
                        and outreach on social media to bring more awareness to your business and promote deals.

                         normal, this new mindset will likely stick around. Stockpiling and seeking out

                        customized service. Using a subscription model, you can offer a certain amount of
                         meals per week, exclusive perks like free monthly products, or form partnerships
                          with other businesses to provide unique packages. Since memberships are an ongoing

                         you can allow your customers to buy gift cards—online or offline,

                    <p>Instead of relying on sales, is it possible to rent your products? While this 
                        may require extra sanitization efforts when items are returned, it can be an excellent
                         revenue source. Like the membership option, renting out equipment or products can 
                         provide a regular revenue stream while you reorganize. Owners of <a href="/building.html">Cyclebar East Cobb,</a>
                          a cycling studio in Marietta, 
                        Georgia, allowed customers to rent stationary bikes to stay fit during the lockdown.

                    <p>Don’t forget, you can always survey your community to discover new ways
                        to pivot. Do this by connecting with your customers, employees, and suppliers 
                        through social media or even just calling them. One example is Lively Run Dairy, 
                        where the owners realized that they could buy excess milk and make cheese to donate 
                        to food banks, rather than let farmers dump it. They turned to GoFundMe to help fund their idea 
                        — and it worked. Within a day they had met their goal of $20,000.
                    </p>  
                    <p>Simply keying into consumer wants and needs during this time can help you discover
                         new ways to stay connected and retain customers—even if you aren’t breaking the bank.

                         you stay in touch with your customers are not only short-term measures but 
                         can become long-term revenue streams.
