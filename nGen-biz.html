                    <p> nGen Works is a digital creative firm that provides web design, 
                        web development and internet marketing consulting services to clients in
                         the U.S. and abroad. We are an unwavering proponent of the user experience,
                          putting people before technology. We’re also the creators of Happy Webbies
                         and like to drink beer. And play video games.
                    </p>
                    <p>Carl Smith is the founding member of nGen Works, a digital creative firm 
                        that has been building some of the world’s finest hand-crafted websites since 
                        2003. Carl has made a name for himself in the web world by always defending 
                        the needs and wants of the end-user. He has been privileged to lead teams 
                        that have been awarded the New York Art Directors Award For Interactive 
                        Development, The Hospitality Industry’s Best of Show Award, two National 
                        C.A.S.E. awards for Educational Web Development. He has also been featured 
                        in Kelly Goto’s best selling book Web Redesign: Workflow That Works. Carl 
                        spends most of his free time complaining about sites that say “click here,” 
                        chasing his daughters, and praying they never make Spiderman 4.

                    <h2>What were the reasons that lead you to start using Pulse?</h2>
                </div>
                
                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>I started using Pulse to kill that sick feeling in my stomach when I didn’t 
                        know if we would make payroll. Being in an industry full of 50/50 payment 
                        projects, or getting paid in thirds, it can be super confusing when money 
                        will come in. Receivables don’t tell half the story, or even a third sometimes. So I went 
                        looking for a solution and low and behold I found Pulse.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ultimately [Pulse] helps me see potential outcomes as I play with “what if” scenarios.
                    </p>
                </div>
    
                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>Describe how you use Pulse and how it fits within your accounting workflow.</h2>
                </div>
    
                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>Basically I use Pulse separately from our accounting system. As the business owner,
                         it’s really my toy and my baby. I manually update when it looks like cash will 
                         come in and variations in payables. Sometimes I look at how cashflow from a project 
                         will impact us and decide if we really want a project, or if a client starts acting 
                         up what the impact will be if we walk away. Thanks to Pulse I know right now we’re 
                         solid through May of 2010 so we can take 2 weeks off as a company at the end of the
                          year. Without Pulse I might not be as confident in that decision. It also helps 
                          when looking at employee bonuses and planning for conferences. 
                          Ultimately it helps me see potential 
                        outcomes as I play with “what if” scenarios.

                    <p>The flexibility. It’s so easy to add or remove a project, or shift a receivable or expense.
                         It’s also easy on the eyes which is a plus for us. It’s funny, but I’ve shown it
                          to colleagues and clients because I think it helps position us as a smart business.
                         Hopefully I’ve turned a lot of people onto Pulse.

                          out over a year ago and you ended up adding that feature in.
                         You had me as a customer at that point because you listened.
