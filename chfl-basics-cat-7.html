                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>The excitement of starting a new business and changing the world 
                        can be exhilarating. In the emotion of the startup phase, 
                        it is easy to lose sight of the fact that there are many unknowns. 
                    </p>
                    <p>The <a href="/building.html">prospective customers</a> that committed to buying your first prototype
                         may back out. The employees you count on most might be approached 
                         with a different offer. If you overspend on unnecessary overhead,
                          then you increase your
                         risks in the face of storms that will inevitably come your way.
                    </p>
                    <p>The first thing to do is ensure you are clear on your cash flow. 
                        We're a little biased, but we feel like Pulse provides that framework
                         to see the past, present and future for your cash position. It helps 
                         you make decisions that are informed and factual.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you want to manage your burn rate, then here are four ways to 
                        <a href="/building.html">integrate cash flow management</a> into growing your business:
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraf-head">
                    <h4>1. Examine the Impacts</h4>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p> When you decide to make a large purchase, input the expense into Pulse
                         and see how this will impact your cash position.
                          You can get an instant view of 
                        what will happen months down the road from your decision.
                    </p>
                    <p>When we want something - new computers, office furniture, company 
                        cars, etc. - our emotions can pull us in a hypnotic way. If you 
                        practice a bit of personal process and look at the numbers before
                         you make the decision, you can move from emotion to logic.
                          If the numbers work out and 
                        the risk is small, then at least you can quantify the impact.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraf-head">
                    <h4>2. Delay A Month</h4>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>The likelihood is that you can get by without committing to 
                        a new subscription or a new purchase. In the cases 
                        where it is clear you cannot, then you have little choice. 
                    </p>
                    <p>But delay a month and see if you can get by without the extra purchases. 
                        Every new tool or commitment you make will increase your monthly burn rate.
                    </p>
                    <p>If you are pre-revenue, especially, then delay on the niceties
                         until you have revenue to account for your purchases.
                    </p>
                    <p>This little habit in your business approach will keep you from a lot of
                         headaches and heartaches. You will find that the things you thought 
                         were so important could simply be luxuries. See if you can get by
                         without new overhead or costs. Learn to take delight in delaying.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraf-head">
                    <h4>3. Plan Around The Next Year</h4>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p> You can also set up predictive models for income in the next year.
                         This will help you understand your cash flow over months. 
                         When you have this picture, go back into your <a href="/building.html">Pulse</a>
                          numbers and play with different scenarios. 
                        This will provide a sensitivity to what may happen in reality.
                    </p>
                    <p>After you get a good sense of probabilities, set up an expense 
                        category that allows you to have a spending account on overhead items you may 
                        want to accelerate your goals, increase morale or reward employees.
                    </p>
                    <p>This tells you how your expenses will fit into a bigger picture. Use this as
                         a budget item and don't exceed it.
                    </p>
                    <p>Pulse effectively helped you forecast with a budgeted item around 
                        a burn rate you are comfortable with.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="paragraf-head">
                    <h4>4. Analyze Before Jumping</h4>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p> Ultimately, your burn rate can be managed with an approach that
                         centers around analysis before emotion. Take a look at what the numbers are 
                        telling you and understand your risks before committing to new expenses.
                    </p>
                    <p>This helps curb the appetite for new and shiny things that may 
                        not be necessary. Make it a management approach and you will 
                        mitigate the possibilities of running out of cash
                         prematurely through the startup phase of your business.
