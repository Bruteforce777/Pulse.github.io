                <h2>List of Sub-processors</h2>
                <p>As noted in our Privacy Policy, we may employ third party companies or service
                     providers and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on 
                     our behalf, to perform Service-related services and/or to assist us in analyzing 
                     how our Service is used.
                </p>
                <p>These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform specific
                     tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to 
                    disclose or use your information for any other purpose.
                </p>
                <p>GDPR defines third party companies and service providers like these as “sub-processors”.</p>
                <p>Where applicable, we’ve linked to each sub-processor’s policies; we recommend reading each one 
                    to make sure you’re OK with us sharing some of your data with them.

                <h2>Access to Your Information (DSR Requests)</h2>
                <p>Another term that GDPR defines is “Data subject”. Put simply, a data subject is the 
                    individual whom particular personal data is about. A DSR (Data Subject Rights) request
                     is when an individual asks a data controller to take action on their personal data. 
                     An example of a DSR request would be if a Pulse customer asks for an export of all 
                     the data they have entered into Pulse, or to
                     permanently delete all the information they’ve entered into Pulse.
                </p>
                <p>We plan on processing these requests manually, though we’ve built some tools to allow 
                    our customers to access, correct,
                     amend, or delete most of their data themselves.
                </p>
                <p>We will give a Pulse customer access to any personal information we have about them 
                    within 30 days of any request for that information, and we won’t charge anything to 
                    process these requests. Individuals may request to access, correct, amend or delete 
                    information we hold about them by contacting us using the information below. Unless
                     prohibited by law, we will remove any Personal Information about an individual 
                     from our servers at their request.
