                    <p> <a href="/building.html">Nicole Rollender</a> describes herself as an “accidental entrepreneur.” 
                        When she left her executive position in the publishing industry in 2017, 
                        she had full intentions to find another full-time job in the publishing industry.
                         After all, Nicole had spent ten years in editorial roles, including the editor-in-chief 
                        of two entrepreneurial magazines in the apparel space.
                    </p>
                    <p>But the more she thought about it, the more Nicole realized that she was
                         primed to start her own business. Nicole had spent over a decade writing 
                         for and about entrepreneurs. At the same time, she had the writing skills
                         and industry insight to provide value to various organizations.
                    </p>
                    <p>Unlike other potential entrepreneurs who test the waters by freelancing for 
                        the first few months, Nicole hit the ground running by establishing 
                       <a href="/building.html"> Strand Writing Services</a> as a full-fledged business on day one. Her goal was to make her
                         transition from full-time employee
                         to self-employed business owner as seamless as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>“That's why I think I was able to grow pretty quickly and create a sustainable 
                        but also scalable business,” says Nicole.
                    </p>
                    <p>But in a digital sea of agencies, freelancers, and gig workers, all with 
                        varying business models, Nicole knew she needed
                         a simple but effective way to manage her business from the start.
                    </p>
                    <p>We sat down with Nicole in our recent episode of the Cash Flow Show to discuss what 
                        she’s learned from creating a business and how she plans to keep it sustainable.

                        <h2>Know what to delegate
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>“I do all of my writing,” says Nicole. “I’m selling my intellectual property and my creativity.
                         And so if I were to outsource in 
                        an agency type model, that would be diluting what I’m selling.”
                    </p>
                    <p>For that reason, Nicole decided to reject the agency model to scale and hasn’t hired additional writers.
                         However, she has taken on a business manager and researcher.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I really wanted a right-hand person as my business manager who knew the business inside and out,
                         was committed with someone like me, who did stay with her clients in the long term,” 
                         notes Nicole. “You can really get bogged down with doing that stuff. And it makes 
                        sense to have somebody there helping with it earlier rather than later.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Spending money on not just hiring people, but hiring the right people, has
                         allowed Nicole to set time aside to focus on her writing rather than administrative tasks.
                          The funds spent
                         on her business, even its hiring contractors, offset her taxes.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>Protect your business with strategic payment terms
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Business success isn’t just about delivering a valuable service or product. 
                        Setting beneficial payment terms from the outset can save business owners
                        from constant payday headaches.
                    </p>
                    <p>It’s common for independent contractors to have retainers, but not every client
                        needs ongoing work. In the case of large, one-off projects, many contractors ask
                         for a 50% advance payment and bill the rest post-delivery. While this payment 
                        structure benefits clients, it can be a problem if they skip the final payment.
                    </p>
                    <p>To avoid late payments or no payments, Nicole requires payments upfront.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I’ve met a lot of people who think that it’s crazy. But it’s not,” says Nicole.
                         “Actually, a lot of businesses are switching to 100%,
                         full upfront payments, and I’ve had no resistance to it.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Asking for full payment upfront isn't at all far fetched if you have:</p>

                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> A good track record<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Excellent and extensive testimonials<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Positive reviews<br>
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Proven delivery time
                    </p>
                    <p>Having money paid upfront allows Nicole to accurately 
                        pace her project, forecast her cash flow, 
                        and ensure she can make all of her business payments with peace of mind.
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, Nicole has decided on a minimum of six-month retainers. 
                        Three-month retainers are often too short since usually one month is 
                        spent onboarding, and a year may be too long for clients who aren’t 
                        sure. Six-month retainers, however,
                         provide stability and security for both parties involved.

                    <p>Since Nicole works with a small team, ensuring that the foundations of her 
                        business are sustainable is crucial. Undercharging, poor
                         project management, and a lack 
                        of direction are real dangers for writers and other creative contractors.

                    <p>Nicole took it upon herself to make sure she avoided common pitfalls
                         for writers and other content creators. She took care to position 
                         her copywriting services correctly through participating in courses, 
                         working with coaches,
                        and building her packages to appeal to her ideal client.
                    </p>
                    <p>Nicole kept a tight watch on her finances and cash flow to get her prices right. 
                        She continues looking at short-term projections and making sure that her operations
                         run smoothly.

                        not planning to go back to traditional employment,” says Nicole. “So I think,
                         ‘What is key to balancing my personal and professional objectives?’”
                    </p>
                    <p>For Nicole, it’s avoiding burn out. But she still has goals to meet for her annual
                        and monthly income. Experimenting with her service packages, garnering customer
                        feedback, and understanding her limits feed into her cash flow. Which, in turn, 
                        feeds into her business decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>“We track every single expense, everything that goes in, everything that goes out,” 
                        says Nicole. “And the first year that I gave my accountant my spreadsheet, 
                        he said that he’s never seen anything so comprehensive and organized.”
