                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>Ecommerce exploded in 2020 as companies big and small across the globe struggled
                        to retain their customer base during strict lockdowns. 
                        Since then, investing in online selling and marketplaces has become the norm.
                    </p>
                    <p>For former freelancer and now agency owner <a href="/building.html">Sam Waldman,</a> the boom in online 
                        marketplace selling has only helped him scale his ecommerce consultancy, <a href="/building.html">Goodz.</a>
                         Based in Mexico City, Sam helps businesses sell successfully 
                        on popular ecommerce marketplaces like Amazon and Mercado Libre.
                    </p>
                    <p>And as an owner of the ecommerce company <a href="/building.html">Iluminación Vintage,</a> Sam understands 
                        the challenges his 
                        customers face when it comes to selling their products and building revenue.
                    </p>
                    <p>We spoke with Sam to learn more about ecommerce, 
                        Goodz, and how cash flow affects the business.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>From freelancer to agency
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Starting from a team of one at Goodz, Sam eventually decided to take on 
                        more people as the demand for his services increased. Bringing on more 
                        people meant adding complexity and potential expenses,
                         but also allowed him to focus more on providing value in his services. 
                    </p>
                    <p>After all, growing your business takes experimentation and time. You are building 
                        long-lasting client pipelines and systemizing your processes.
                    </p>
                    <p>You also need to look at how you can afford to bring people on board. Generally, 
                        you don’t just want a high demand to fuel hires. For a full-time hire, you’ll 
                        need to be able to have enough cash flow to cover their salary, benefits, and 
                        other potential incentives. If you cannot do this, or if you aren’t sure, bringing on 
                        independent contractors or part-time workers can give you more flexibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>No matter how you choose to hire, cash flow management and projections 
                        factor into the decision. Often, it can be helpful to review other aspects 
                        of your financials if your cash flow isn’t enough to hire help.
                    </p>
                    <p>When Sam transitioned from freelancing to running an agency and the demand for
                         his services grew, he first began by reviewing different cash flow scenarios. 
                         Understanding that demand and modeling different financial
                         scenarios helped him determine when he could bring on more people.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>Testing revenue models
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p> The first thing that Sam had to consider was his revenue model. Some 
                        consultant agencies prefer to charge a percentage of sales,
                         while others have a flat fee based on services provided.
                    </p>
                    <p>“I tried a lot of things in the beginning,” says Sam, “but I ended up 
                        going with a service-based revenue structure.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Sam first needed to ensure that his revenue model would cover the basic costs
                        of providing services. After all, you have to do a lot of work upfront to run 
                        a successful business that sells on Amazon or another marketplace. Before 
                        launching an online store or product, he has to help clients coordinate keyword
                         research, copywriting, product descriptions, and other front-end tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>To maintain steady cash flow, Sam ended up combining a flat service retainer fee with 
                        a potential additional percentage charge. Here’s how this model works:
                    </p>
                    <p>First, there is a base fee for consulting and providing services. Let’s say it’s $1000 per month.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once customers reach a certain point in sales, they are charged a percentage fee. For example, 
                        if the customer sells more than $10,000 worth of product in a month based 
                        on the agency’s retainer work, he would charge an additional 10% fee.
                    </p>
                    <p>This additional percentage charge is an incentive for Sam to achieve positive
                         results and helps offset further costs that can crop up due to continued 
                         optimization. Additional market research, tracking, remarketing, and 
                        editing less successful products can easily drain time and resources.
                    </p>

                    <p> “You can forecast as much as you want, but it 
                        comes down to keeping solid records,” says Sam.
                    </p>
                    <p>As someone with an ecommerce store himself, Sam 
                        understands cash flow management for both sellers and consultants.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sellers often have to monitor their cash flow carefully. Marketplaces
                        like Amazon don’t release funds immediately. Instead, sellers receive their 
                        funds every 14-15 days, so managing expenses and bill timetables can be critical.
                         After all, sellers tend to have significant expenses, including:

                    </p>
                    <p>Sellers will also need to keep track of sales, returns, discounts, and 
                        other similar information to track the 
                        success of their products and ensure they don’t run out of inventory.

                <div class="schooling">

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p> By comparison, the agency model typically has fewer expenses or the same wait for 
                        receiving payments. It can take a few days for payment processors like Stripe or
                         PayPal to deposit funds. Overall, though, receiving
                         payments is faster and enables him to reinvest in his business quicker.
                    </p>
                    <p>But that isn’t to say that the agency model is centered around headcount. 
                        The cost of specialty software for keyword and marketplace research can add up,
                         especially as your team grows. Not to mention you may have to pay your team 
                         upfront to create the listings, digital storefront, 
                        and other materials before getting the final paycheck.
                    </p>
                    <p>For the agency business, Sam tracks the number of sellers managed, the fee per service, 
                        leads generated, and sales numbers. At the same time, he tracks specific metrics for his clients,
                         such as sales per channel,
                         best-selling products, and advertising ROI, among others.
                    </p>
                    <p>To ensure that his cash flow is on track for both his businesses, Sam uses a spreadsheet.
                         As an experienced Exel teacher and consultant, he has been able to craft useful and
                          to-the-point reports. While they are not as detailed as he would like, keeping track of his
                         cash flow is one of the core aspects of running his business.
                    </p>
                    <p>For growing agencies and ecommerce sellers alike, monitoring payment schedules 
                        can help you to make better decisions for your business that will keep your
                         finances healthy. If and when you can bring on help, launch a new product, 
                        or expand into a new market—all of these depend on your day-to-day cash flow.
