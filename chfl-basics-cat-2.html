                    <p> What are the healthiest businesses doing today that
                         every business—no matter how small—can emulate? 
                        That’s an easy question: It’s monitoring cash flow.
                    </p>
                    <p>Your cash flow is the lifeline of your business. 
                       Infact <a href="/small-business-main.html">69% of small business owner</a> report that they are losing sleep over their cash flow—or lack thereof.
                    </p>
                    <p>The real problem with cash flow is that it’s a bit like
                        working out. If you aren’t regularly monitoring it, your 
                        records are going to be out of date and skewed. And when 
                        you don’t have accurate accounts of your cash on hand, 
                        you put your business at risk of
                         hemorrhaging money—and possibly shutting down completely.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="schooling">
                    <h4>“That's because school is my bread and butter. And I really, really 
                        enjoy it so that has to take priority. But I plan it in such a way 
                        that I make the most use of my school 
                        time for school, so I have most time at home for the business.
                    </h4>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">

                    <p>You may be looking at your current books and think—why 
                        does cash flow matter? I’m making a profit!
                    </p>
                    <p>But cash flow isn’t profit. Put simply, your cash flow is 
                        the cash you have on hand to run your business. You may
                         have enough cash saved up for a month, two months,
                         maybe three. Or perhaps you don’t have any extra cash on hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>Take a look at what happened with <a href="/building.html">COVID-19.</a> Thousands of 
                        businesses found themselves without a source of cash flow, 
                        meaning they had to rely on their reserves. Those who couldn’t 
                        find operating capital, from bank loans to collecting payments, 
                        folded. According to estimates from the Washington Post, 
                        the figures from March to
                         May suggested over <a href="/building.html">100,000 businesses</a> shut down permanently.
                    </p>
                    <p>Understanding your cash flow is one way to prevent closure 
                        due to unexpected (and expected) events. If you aren’t 
                        reviewing it in the long-term, you won’t be prepared for future 
                        disruptions, and you certainly <a href="/building.html">won’t be able to scale.</a>
                    </p>
                </div>

                        <h2>What happens if you don’t track cash flow?
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Pandemics and extreme disruptions aside, there are 
                        plenty of events that can be derailed (or derail your
                         business) if you are recording and analyzing your cash flow.
                          Remember how we said it’s like exercising? Your business can 
                          pick up some pretty serious ailments if you’re not keeping track.
                           On the other hand, understanding
                         your cash flow can also open new opportunities.
                    </p>
                    <p>This is what happened to the owner of Simple Focus, JD Graffam, who 
                        eventually purchased Pulse App. “I started trying to figure out how
                         to calculate how much money I needed at the end of the year,” says
                          Graffam on the <a href="/building.html">Elite Entrepreneurs </a> podcast, “I discovered not only 
                          how much I made personally, but how much I could 
                          reinvent in the business. Or even 
                        if I was in a position to buy another business.”
                    </p>
                    <p>It’s easy enough. But cash flow is often only hastily compiled
                         during a crisis or maybe even tax season. But when we use cash 
                         flow analysis so haphazardly, we end up wasting more time and energy.
                          In a way, it’s a lot like exercising. Do it regularly, and the 
                           is easy. But try it only once
                         and a while and you’re left sore and unmotivated.</p>
                    <p>Here are our top six examples of things that can go wrong 
                        if you aren’t monitoring your cash flow:
                    </p>

                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>1. Overstocked and overspent
                    </h2>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    
                    <p>Have you ever worked out too much, but didn’t realize it because
                         you weren’t keeping track of your schedule? Or maybe you wanted 
                         to get in shape in two weeks for a beach trip? When you 
                         exercise too much, you can end up 
                        hurting yourself. The same is true when it comes to spending.
                    </p>
                    <p> If you haven’t been monitoring your cash flow, you may not realize
                         how much you are spending with suppliers. Whether you have your 
                         supplier orders on an automated platform or not, you need to 
                         understand how much money is going out and how much inventory 
                         you need to move. Because the fact is,
                         you don’t make money until you sell your stock.
                    </p>   
                </div>

                <div class="stories-sub-head-2">
                    <h2>2. Stretched out payment terms
                    </h2>

                    <p>Conversely, what about those of us who only workout once in 
                        a while? If you don’t exercise regularly, you aren’t getting
                         the benefits. What about businesses that don’t collect their payments, 
                        or only do so after an extended period? Same deal.
                    </p>
                    <p> Another issue is your payment terms. When are you getting paid? If you aren’t 
                        looking closely, you may be spreading your payment dates too far. 
                        This means that it can easily become difficult to pay a supplier 
                        or a loan if your customers miss their payment deadline.

                    <p>If you’ve ever worked out at the gym, it’s easy to use one of those
                         body trainer machines the wrong way and end up spraining something.
                          When you mistake profits for cash flow,
                         you’re essentially hurting yourself in the same way.
                    </p>
                    <p> Remember when we talked about profits and cash flow not being the same thing?
                         If you aren’t separating the two, it’s easy to mistake your operating 
                         cash for profit. This means you may accidentally overspend your operating cash and end up
                         in a pickle when you suddenly need to buy new equipment.
                    </p>

                    <p>Working out can also keep you healthy and prevent a variety of
                         illnesses. If you think of managing your cash
                         flow as a preventative measure, it serves a similar purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p> Speaking of sudden repairs, unplanned expenses may put you in a 
                        hole. If you don’t know how much cash you have on hand, you don’t 
                        have enough saved for emergencies. These expected expenses can 
                        include needing to suddenly rehire an employee, broken equipment,
                         customer refunds, your supplier going out of business, and 
                         needing to find a replacement. All of these things can add up, 
                         and small business loans aren’t easy to get. Rather than depend on loans, 
                        you can plan ahead when you control your cash flow.

                    <p>We’ve looked at a lot of different aspects of not taking control
                         of your cash flow, from stretching out your cash on hand to being 
                         unable to prepare for unexpected expenses. All this boils down 
                         to one main point: If you aren’t tracking your cash flow from 
                         the beginning—if you can’t account for every cent in your 
                         business—you aren’t going to be able to make the best decisions possible. 
                        After all, you won’t have all the information in front of you.
                    </p>
                    <p> Keeping an easy-to-read record of your finances means 
                        that you can make informed decisions 
                        not just based on your needs today, but a year ahead or more.

                        <h2>How we look at cash flow
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>When it comes to cash flow, you first need to write down all of your
                         income streams and where you are spending your money. Your expenses
                          don't just include office supplies and payroll, but also potential
                           loans and taxes. Income can also involve 
                        things like dividends from stocks and the worth of your assets.
                    </p>
                    <p>Once you list all of these, you need to lay out when each item is due or
                         received for each month. This will help you understand 
                         how much money you really have on hand
                         and if you need to make payment term adjustments.
                    </p>
                    <p>Finally, it can help to look at the next 12 months to project 
                        how much cash flow you’ll have every month and at the end of the 
                        year. This won’t just make it easy to understand your
                         finances, you’ll be able to make long-term decisions.
                    </p>   
                    <p>Spreadsheets are great for starting out, but can quickly 
                        become complicated. “My first spreadsheet was great, 
                        but it was very detailed,” says Graffam, “And when 
                        I pulled it up months later, it was like starting over. 
                        Because spreadsheets aren't made for maintenance. 
                        You either need to maintain it everyday or start over.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Ideally, you want a program that won’t make you second guess 
                        your math or take hours of upkeep. As your business expands, 
                        you’ll find that monitoring your different sources of revenue
                         and expenses becomes vastly more difficult. So, 
                         just as if you were weight training,
                         make sure to adjust your tools as you scale.

                    <p>Monitoring your cash flow lets you maintain flexibility while
                         strengthening your business. If you don’t know how much money 
                         is going in and out, what actually counts as operating cash versus 
                         your profits, then you’ll have a hard time making decisions.
                         But it doesn’t have to be that way. You can take back control 
                        of your business finances by just monitoring your cash flow.
