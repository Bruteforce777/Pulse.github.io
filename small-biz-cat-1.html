                    <p><a href="/building.html">Justin Green, CFP®, MSPFP</a> is a fiduciary financial planner
                         who helps business owners and self-employed professionals 
                        manage their money. But it wasn’t always that way.
                    </p>
                    <p>After four years of working at a traditional retirement planning firm,
                         Justin decided he wanted to work with his peers rather than retirement-age
                          clients. He enjoyed engaging with Millennials, Gen Xers, and Gen Z savers, 
                          and he knew there was a
                        huge financial planning gap for those younger generations.
                    </p>
                    <p>In late 2020, he decided it was time to go out on his own and start <a href="/building.html">Assist FP,</a>
                         a virtual financial planning firm. In starting his own business, Justin doesn’t 
                         just talk about cash flow and business finances,
                         he’s experienced all the ups and downs himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>We had the chance to speak to Justin about the decisions he made when starting
                         his business, as well as his advice for small
                         business owners, entrepreneurs, and independent contractors.

                        <h2>5 Cash Flow Tips for the Self-Employed
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                    <p> Justin helps families in traditional full-time jobs and 
                        self-employed individuals plan their financial futures. 
                        As a result, he understands the temptation to overlap personal
                         and business expenses and the challenges associated with keeping 
                         business finances separate. Once you begin using personal accounts 
                         for business or vice versa 
                        it becomes very difficult to effectively manage business finances.
                    </p>
                    <p>“With self-employment, personal cash flow and business cash flow
                         sometimes are commingled and so it's very 
                        important to get them to separate those,” says Justin.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="schooling">
                    <h4>"A lot of people avoid the numbers because they're
                         scared of what it's going to tell them"
                    </h4>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>Commingling is just one of the problems that Justin has
                         frequently come across in his work. Here are five more
                          actional tips business owners and contractors can implement 
                          today for better cash flow:
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>1. Focus on the numbers</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Surprisingly, the most common issue that Justin notices is that
                         most entrepreneurs don’t want to look at the numbers at all.
                    </p>
                    <p>“A lot of people avoid the numbers because they're scared of what 
                        it's going to tell them, so they might feel that tension that 
                        something isn't making sense with the cash flow or things are super 
                        tight or their expenses are clearly higher than their income.”
                    </p>
                    <p>However, the only way to find a businesses’ pain points is to get 
                        an overview of the cash flow. That’s where Justin starts when 
                        organizing business finances. Once an owner sees the numbers,
                         it’s much easier to make data-driven business decisions.
                    </p>

                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>2. Don’t make plans based on assumptions</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Whether you are planning for retirement or estimating where your
                         business will be in five years, it’s easy to make assumptions 
                         based on your current consumer base. Instead, 
                        Justin suggests keeping projections more current and short-term.
                    </p>
                    <p>“For example, I try not to do a lot of retirement projections 
                        for Millennials, because so many assumptions 
                        would go into a projection and it just wouldn't be accurate.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Instead of looking too far into the future, it’s more beneficial
                         if individuals focus on meeting short-term goals around long-term business processes.
                         The important thing is to be continually moving towards your goal.

                        <h2>3. Be aware of expense creep</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>As a business grows, it’s easy to take on more expenses. Often called 
                        “lifestyle creep” in personal finance, the same principle applies to 
                        business spending. Spending can rapidly become a problem if left unchecked.
                    </p>
                    <p>Justin usually directs his clients to the business model in Profit
                         First <a href="/building.html">by Mike Michalowicz</a> to help with cash flow. <a href="/building.html"> Business owners</a> 
                         need to have a system that allows
                         them to “take profit first” to ensure proper cash flow.
                    </p>
                    <p>Normally, a business subtracts its expenses from its income to find the profit. 
                        In the “profit first” method, businesses should account for profit before adding in expenses. 
                        What is leftover after your profit can be used for business operations.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Of course, if your cash flow situation is not very great, then it's going to be 
                        a very small profit at the beginning. 
                        But once you get in the habit, that profit will grow,” comments Justin.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>4. Have an effective accounting system</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Keeping personal and business finances separate is critical for efficient accounting. 
                        Justin recommends having multiple bank accounts, one each for taxes, expenses, and profit.
                         This type of virtual envelope system makes it easy to track expenses and 
                        income while also ensuring that the business sticks to its budget.
                    </p>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <p>But setting big goals and keeping up with forecasts also plays
                        a big part in his success.
                   </p>
                   <p>“I have forecasts, and I'm looking forward towards the future. 
                       And I set gigantic goals. There's no reason why I can't have 
                       a $50,000 month,” says Isaac. “I'd say I have our financial milestones 
                       set for the next four to five years.”
                   </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>5. Save for taxes ahead of time</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Planning for taxes ahead of time can help you accurately plan your 
                        cash flow and lower your stress. Simply keeping that money aside in a
                         separate account can give you peace of mind every quarter.
                    </p>
                    <p>“It’s best to save 15-20% per month from their income for taxes and set
                         it aside,” says Justin. “So when their tax bill does come quarterly,
                         there’s no stress about where to pull it from.”
                    </p>
                    <p>The simpler and more streamlined the process is, the easier it is to
                         pay the IRS and handle any potential audits. At the same time,
                         you can rest easy knowing that your taxes are taken care of.

                        Whether you are a solopreneur, the founder of a startup, or a small

                        <h2>More Insight From Justin On How He Built His Business</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Justin doesn’t just offer advice to other business owners and entrepreneurs—he shares 
                        in the hardships of creating a business from scratch.
                   </p>
                   <p>Justian explained that there were two essential points he needed to focus 
                       on to create a solid financial base for his business:
                   </p>
                   <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Pricing for the Millennial market<br>
                       <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> Factoring compliance expenses
                   </p>
                </div>

                <div class="social-text">
                    <div class="stories-sub-head">
                        <h2>Pricing for Millennials</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>Justin chose from two business models to set his pricing. The first 
                        and more common model was a brokerage practice, which is commission-based.
                         While the advice is free for the client,
                         the advisor is paid by a third-party to push their products.
                   </p>
                   <p>The second option was to act as a fiduciary and bill the client directly. 
                    A <a href="/building.html">fiduciary financial planner</a> is someone who is legally bound to put the client’s
                     best interest above all else. This type of advisor is not allowed to work on 
                     commission and is paid directly by the client with a fee. Most traditional 
                     fiduciaries take a flat 1-2% percentage fee for assets under management (AUM),
                      which is the total value of your individual investments.
                   </p>
                   <p>Rather than model his pricing structure entirely on the traditional 
                      percentage fee, Justin added one-time advising
                      packages and a subscription as his primary offering.
                    </p>
                    <p>To meet the needs of Millennials and Gen Z, Justin has three core offerings:</p>
                    <p><i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> a 2-session financial planning offer with a single fee
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> a subscription for ongoing financial planning and advice
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-check"></i> a percentage fee add-on for investment management
                    </p>
                    <p>This pricing structure allows him to provide tailored services to younger 
                        clientele no matter where they are in their saving journey.
                         It also helps Justin better serve self-employed individuals.
                    </p>
                    <p>For example, with the subscription model, Justin can help advise with cash
                         flow analysis, debt management, and tax planning, along with their personal 
                         savings needs. But a young couple looking to buy their first house won’t need such a robust plan.
                         So they may choose to invest in his two-session package instead.

                    <p>“Because I’m working with younger clients, there are definitely different 
                        stages of life when we are working together and sometimes they need some basic advice,” says Justin.
                         “Different subscriptions allow me to help younger clients.”

                        <h2>Keeping Track of Expenses</h2>
                    </div>
                    <p>While Justin is able to keep his expenses fairly lean, being a fiduciary 
                        comes with compliance requirements, such as keeping permanent client files 
                        with all communication and planning materials, making backups and copies of
                         all marketing materials in case of an audit, and ensuring that clients are 
                         given written policy documentation. Most of his business expenses go towards 
                         essential compliance or planning software such as Advice Pay, a payment processor 
                         that allows him to stay 
                        compliant with his billing practices and review his projected revenue.
                    </p>
                    <p>Cash flow projection has been an important piece of the puzzle from the very beginning.
                         With a clear window into his finances, Justin can better track his income and 
                         expenses. The most useful feature for him is to be able to toggle different dates 
                         in the future and forecast his potential earnings.
                    </p> 
                    <p>“That's extremely helpful for me because, as I continue to grow, 
                        that projected income is based on ongoing subscriptions that I already 
                        have set up,” notes Justin. “That allows me to see when 
                        I can start to outsource some tasks to other professionals.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Justin tends to stick with three-month or six-month projections, 
                        and then use that information to plan potential <a href="/building.html">business investments</a>
                        such as hiring contractors for marketing.

                             I knew the previous owners personally and knew they hadn't neglected Pulse,
                             but they weren't actively building new features, either.
